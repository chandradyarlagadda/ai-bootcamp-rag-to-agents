       "RawRepositoryFile(filename='docs/library/tags_metadata.mdx', content='---\\ntitle: \\'Add tags and metadata\\'\\ndescription: \\'How to add metadata to evaluations.\\'\\n---\\n\\nThis is relevant when you logging Reports to the Platform. Tags help you associate each Report with a specific model / prompt version, time period, or other context.\\n\\n## Add timestamp\\n\\nEach Report run has a single timestamp. By default, Evidently assigns `datetime.now()` as the run time based on the user\\'s time zone.\\n\\nYou can also specify a custom timestamp by passing it to the `run()` method:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom datetime import datetime\\n\\nmy_eval_4 = report.run(eval_data_1,\\n                       eval_data_2,\\n                       timestamp=datetime(2024, 1, 29))\\n```\\n\\nBecause timestamps are fully customizable, you can log Reports asynchronously or with a delay. For example, make an evaluation after receiving ground truth and backdate Reports to the relevant time period.\\n\\n## Add tags and metadata\\n\\nYou can add `tags` and `metadata` to Reports to support search and ease of filtering. Tags also let you visualize data from specific subsets of Reports on monitoring Panels.\\n\\nUse tags in the following scenarios:\\n* Mark evaluation runs by model version, prompt version, or test scenario.\\n* Indicate status: production, shadow, champion/challenger, A/B versions.\\n* Identify Reports by geography, use case, user segment, or role.\\n* Tag based on reference dataset windows (for example, weekly vs. monthly drift comparisons)\\n* Highlight Reports with a specific role, such as datasheet or model card.\\n\\n**Custom tags**. You can add tags to the Report. Pass any custom Tags as a list:\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    ClassificationPreset()\\n],\\ntags=[\"classification\", \"production\"])\\n```\\n\\n**Custom metadata**. Pass metadata as a Python dictionary in key:value pairs:\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    ClassificationPreset()\\n],\\nmetadata = {\\n\\t\"deployment\": \"shadow\",\\n\\t\"status\": \"production\",\\n\\t})\\n```\\n\\n**Default metadata**. Use built-in metadata fields `model_id`, `reference_id`, `batch_size`, `dataset_id`:\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    ClassificationPreset()\\n],\\n  model_id=\"model_id\",\\n\\treference_id=\"reference_id\",\\n\\tbatch_size=\"batch_size\",\\n\\tdataset_id=\"dataset_id\"\\n)\\n```\\n\\n**Add tags to run**: You can also tag individual Report runs. This is useful for experiments where you re-run the same Report with different prompts or hyperparameter settings.\\n\\n\\n```python\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_data_1, eval_data_2, tags=[\"prompt_v1\", \"claude\"])\\n```')"

We can treat it as a simple **binary classification** problem.\\n\\n**Data definition**. To evaluate the classification quality, we need to map the structure of the dataset accordingly first. The column with the manual label is the \\\"target\\\", and the LLM-judge response is the \\\"prediction\\\":\\n\\n```python\\ndf=eval_dataset.as_dataframe()\\n\\ndefinition_2 = DataDefinition(\\n    classification=[BinaryClassification(\\n        target=\\\"label\\\",\\n        prediction_labels=\\\"Correctness\\\",\\n        pos_label = \\\"incorrect\\\")],\\n    categorical_columns=[\\\"label\\\", \\\"Correctness\\\"])\\n\\nclass_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(\\n    pd.DataFrame(df),\\n    data_definition=definition_2)\\n```\\n\\n<Info>\\n  `Pos_label` refers to the class that is treated as the target (\\\"what we want to predict better\\\") for metrics like precision, recall, F1-score.\\n</Info>\\n\\n**Get a Report**. Let's use a`ClassificationPreset()` that combines several classification metrics:\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    ClassificationPreset()\\n])\\n\\nmy_eval = report.run(class_dataset, None)\\nmy_eval\\n\\n# or my_eval.as_dict()\\n```\\n\\nWe can now get a well-rounded evaluation and explore the confusion matrix. We have one type of error each: overall the results are pretty good\\\\! You can also refine the prompt to try to improve them.\\n\\n![](/images/examples/llm_judge_tutorial_conf_matrix-min.png)\\n\\n## 5. Verbosity evaluator\\n\\nNext, let\\u2019s create a simpler verbosity judge. It will check whether the responses are concise and to the point. This only requires evaluating one output column: such checks are perfect for production evaluations where you don\\u2019t have a reference answer.\\n\\nHere's ho\", \"title\": \"LLM as a judge\", \"description\": \"How to create and evaluate an LLM judge.\", \"filename\": \"examples/LLM_judge.mdx\"}, {\"start\": 4000, \"content\": \"e(df),\\n    data_definition=DataDefinition(\\n        text_columns=[\\\"question\\\", \\\"answer\\\"]),\\n    descriptors=[\\n        Sentiment(\\\"answer\\\", alias=\\\"Sentiment\\\"),\\n        TextLength(\\\"answer\\\", alias=\\\"Length\\\"),\\n        IncludesWords(\\\"answer\\\", words_list=['sorry', 'apologize'], alias=\\\"Denials\\\"),\\n    ]\\n)\\n```\\n\\n**2. Aggregate results or run conditional checks**. Use these descriptors like any other dataset column when creating a Report. For example, here is how you summarize all descriptors and check that the text length is under 100 symbols.\\n\\n```python\\nreport = Report([\\n    TextEvals(),\\n    MaxValue(column=\\\"Length\\\", tests=[lt(100)]),\\n])\\n```\\n\\nThis decoupling means you can reuse descriptor outputs for multiple tests or aggregations without recomputation. It\\u2019s especially useful for LLM evaluations.\\n\\n<Card title=\\\"Descriptors\\\" href=\\\"/docs/library/descriptors\\\">\\n  Docs on adding descriptors.\\n</Card>\\n\\n### New Reports API\\n\\nAs you may have noticed in the example above, we made the changes to the core Report API. Here is how generating a Report with data summary preset for a single dataset works now:\\n\\n```python\\neval_data = Dataset.from_pandas(\\n    pd.DataFrame(source_df),\\n    data_definition=DataDefinition()\\n)\\n\\nreport = Report([\\n    DataSummaryPreset()\\n])\\n\\nmy_eval = report.run(eval_data, None)\\n```\\n\\nKey changes:\\n\\n- The Report object now defines the configuration (e.g., metrics to include).\\n- Running a Report returns a separate result object.\\n\\n<Card title=\\\"Reports\\\" href=\\\"/docs/library/report\\\">\\n  How to generate Reports.\\n</Card>\\n\\nAdditional improvement: you can also now use \\\"Group by\\\" to compute metrics for specific segments.\\n\\n### Test Suites joined with Reports\\n\\nMost importantly,  Reports and Tests are now unified. Previously, these were separate:\\n\\n- Reports provided an overview of metrics (e.g., distribution summaries, statistics).\\n- Tests verify pass/fail conditions (e.g., check for missing data or LLM quality thresholds).\\n\\nNow, the Test Suite mode is an optional extension of a Report.

Create the Dataset\\n\\nFirst, we'll create a toy Q&A dataset with customer support question that includes:\\n\\n- **Questions**. The inputs sent to the LLM app.\\n- **Target responses**. The approved responses you consider accurate.\\n- **New responses**. Imitated new responses from the system.\\n- **Manual labels with explanation**. Labels that say if response is correct or not.\\n\\nWhy add the labels? It's a good idea to be the judge yourself before you write a prompt. This helps:\\n\\n- Formulate better criteria. You discover nuances that help you write a better prompt.\\n- Get the \\\"ground truth\\\". You can use it to evaluate the quality of the LLM judge.\\n\\nUltimately, an LLM judge is a small ML system, and it needs its own evals\\\\!\\n\\n**Generate the dataframe**.

       "\"0:00 So hi everyone. Uh today we are going to\\n0:02 talk about our upcoming course. The\\n0:05 upcoming course is called machine\\n0:06 learning zoom camp. And um this is\\n0:10 already I put the link in the\\n0:12 description. So if you're watching um\\n0:14 this video in recording or you're\\n0:17 watching it live, you go here in the\\n0:19 description after under this video and\\n0:21 then you see a link course. uh click on\\n0:25 that link and this bring you will bring\\n0:27 you to\\n0:29 this website this GitHub page.\\n0:34 This GitHub page is the main entry point\\n0:36 to our course and um yeah I think it's\\n0:41 more or less self-explanatory. If you\\n0:43 want to sign up this is the button you\\n0:45 click and the actual course starts in on\\n0:48 September 15th. it means that it's uh\\n0:51 slightly less than one one month before\\n0:53 the course starts and the purpose of\\n0:55 today's um session is to just answer\\n0:58 your questions. So you have some\\n1:00 questions and uh you can ask these\\n1:03 questions using uh you can ask your\\n1:06 questions using the pinned link. So\\n1:07 there's a pinned link in the live chat.\\n1:09 Click on that link um and there ask your\\n1:14 questions. So yeah, this is how it looks\\n1:17 like and I am just going to uh use this\\n1:21 thing. So we can also go to SLO and use\\n1:24 ML Zoom camp and I'm going to use that\\n1:27 for answering questions. Uh one thing\\n1:29 though, so before we start, I just\\n1:30 wanted to mention that um this course\\n1:33 has been running for uh this will be the\\n1:36 fifth edition of this course. So we've\\n1:39 been doing this course for quite some\\n1:40 time. Many people already graduated from\\n1:43 this course and um most of the content\\n1:46 we use here is the content I uh recorded\\n1:49 like four years ago\\n1:52 but we are updating the content so cuz u\\n1:54 back then everyone was using Python 3.8\\n1:58 eight or nine something like. So yeah,\\n2:01 we are re-recording some of the things\\n2:03 in particular. Module one, two, three,\\n2:06 four will uh stay the same cuz uh this\\n2:10 uh these are the fundamentals. They\\n2:11 didn't change. But module five we uh\\n2:15 will update. Module 6 will stay the\\n2:17 same. Module 8 we will update. Module 9\\n2:21 update update. And this we will not\\n2:23 include like we only include it once and\\n2:25 this thing get outdated very fast. So we\\n2:28 just I just didn't bother updating this\\n2:30 at all and it's pretty advanced\\n2:32 material. So we will update like four\\n2:34 out of 10 modules. So that's the plan.\\n2:38 Uh and we already had some workshops for\\n2:41 this. Anyways um you have some questions\\n2:44 and these questions you use slido for\\n2:47 asking these questions and let's get\\n2:49 started.\\n2:50 Um Alexi question is there a chance of\\n2:53 job placement after the program? How\\n2:55 deep are we going into computer vision\\n2:56 and rock? Okay, so there are three\\n2:58 questions actually here. Uh chance of\\n3:01 job placement. So we do not provide you\\n3:03 job placement. So we are not recruiters.\\n3:06 We just teach this uh and we are not a\\n3:09 boot camp where you pay money. Right? So\\n3:11 this is a free boot camp and our\\n3:13 resources are limited. So we cannot\\n3:14 really uh do this for you. That said,\\n3:18 many of many course participants who\\n3:21 took this course in the past\\n3:23 successfully found the job. So this is\\n3:25 this is going to be the fifth time we\\n3:28 are hosting this. So yeah, many many\\n3:31 people have graduated from this course\\n3:33 and many people found the jobs. So yes,\\n3:35 there is a high chance to find a job\\n3:38 placement after the program because the\\n3:41 teach we the skills we teach here the\\n3:43 skills we cover here\\n3:45 they are the most important skills for a\\n3:48 machine learning engineer. So first we\\n3:49 focus on the machine learning part where\\n3:52 we cover scikitlearn\\n3:54 um like simplest model models and then\\n3:57 we go deeper on the deployment side. So\\n4:00 this is the area where many data\\n4:01 scientists um don't know or not they\\n4:06 know but like maybe this is their weak\\n4:08 areas. So this is we we're going a\\n4:10 little deeper in this side. That's why\\n4:12 it's more like an engineering program,\\n4:14 ML engineering program. And with these\\n4:16 skills, usually people don't have any\\n4:18 problems finding a job. How deep are we\\n4:21 going into computer vision and rack?\\n4:23 Okay. So we don't go deep into computer\\n4:27 vision. We have one module on deep\\n4:31 learning and in this deep learning\\n4:32 module we uh do we build an image\\n4:36 classifier. So this is a model that can\\n4:38 classify different types of clothes into\\n4:43 images of of clothes into 10 different\\n4:46 categories like pants, like shirts, like\\n4:49 t-shirts, stuff like that. So this is as\\n4:52 uh deep as we go to computer vision. So\\n4:54 that's only one module about that. And\\n4:57 we also talk about deploying neural\\n4:59 networks. So in the serverless model we\\n5:02 talked about how okay you have a model\\n5:06 how to deploy it and by the way speaking\\n5:08 of the deep learning model uh previously\\n5:10 we used tensorflow so we are going to\\n5:13 update this to pytorch so this year\\n5:15 you'll have two options you can go with\\n5:17 tensorflow you can also go with pytorch\\n5:21 um but yeah it will be basics so we will\\n5:23 not go deep so this is not a computer\\n5:25 vision class this is a machine learning\\n5:27 engineering class so we will just have\\n5:29 one lesson\\n5:30 And we will focus a lot on deployment\\n5:32 not on the theory part. We do not cover\\n5:35 rack at all. So for rack if you're\\n5:37 interested in rack there is another\\n5:39 course called LLM Zoom camp.\\n5:42 It has almost finished but all the\\n5:46 materials are available for\\n5:48 self-studying. Um so yeah here's you can\\n5:51 check it. So we don't cover a rock in\\n5:54 machine learning course but there's\\n5:55 another course where we go pretty deep\\n5:58 into this maybe not super deep but like\\n6:01 we cover a lot of things when it comes\\n6:03 to AI engineering.\\n6:06 Uh are there any prerequisites to get\\n6:08 the most out of the boot camp? Yes, you\\n6:09 need to be uh comfortable with\\n6:13 programming and with command line. So\\n6:16 some basic linear algebra will help but\\n6:19 this is not super important. So you we\\n6:23 um\\n6:24 provide all the\\n6:27 say refreshment materials here. So we\\n6:30 talk about linear algebra and numpy and\\n6:33 we illustrate everything with code. So\\n6:35 even if you never took linear algeb\\n6:37 algebra class uh the concepts we\\n6:40 explained here they are\\n6:42 there enough. So the main prerequisite\\n6:45 is knowing how to program. If you don't\\n6:48 know Python, you should be able to uh\\n6:51 pick it quickly. And if you know any\\n6:53 other programming language like Java,\\n6:55 JavaScript,\\n6:56 whatever, R, you shouldn't be it\\n6:59 shouldn't be difficult for you to pick\\n7:00 up Python. And then where's actually our\\n7:03 prerequisites?\\n7:06 Yeah, here. And then uh starting with uh\\n7:10 starting from module number five, we\\n7:13 will use command line a lot. And this is\\n7:16 um where this experience with prior\\n7:19 experience using command line will help.\\n7:22 Of course, not everyone has this\\n7:23 experience. So you can pick it up too.\\n7:26 But expect that uh here when we go from\\n7:30 module 4 to module 5. So um if um for\\n7:34 you software engineering is something\\n7:36 you don't do regularly then it's going\\n7:38 to take the model number five is going\\n7:40 to take um significantly more time than\\n7:44 the first four and this is based on what\\n7:47 the students said uh for them the switch\\n7:50 from Jupyter notebook to u creating uh\\n7:55 web services was quite difficult. So\\n7:57 this is um right now we still have a lot\\n8:00 of time. So if you think this is your\\n8:02 weak site, maybe check this module now\\n8:04 and see what are the things you're\\n8:06 lacking you're missing. And also as a um\\n8:10 what we did recently was a workshop\\n8:13 going to share the link with this\\n8:14 workshop where I revised this module\\n8:17 number five. So maybe you can just uh\\n8:21 check that. Let me see.\\n8:24 Um yeah, this one. So I'm going to share\\n8:28 it with you right now. uh here\\n8:33 and I'll also put this in description\\n8:35 for those who are watching this in\\n8:36 recording\\n8:38 workshop on UV and fast API.\\n8:43 So this is a workshop that you can check\\n8:45 right now to see um just to evaluate\\n8:49 yourself if you feel comfortable with\\n8:52 the things that are happening in this\\n8:53 workshop. If you don't feel comfortable,\\n8:55 you still have time to catch up on some\\n8:58 things like using terminal um and so on.\\n9:02 And uh I think there's a question CLI is\\n9:06 it powershell PowerShell or Linux? So we\\n9:09 you in the course we use bash um so it's\\n9:12 not powershell. If you are more\\n9:15 comfortable using powershell that works\\n9:17 too. So the examples should be\\n9:19 transferable to powershell but we use\\n9:21 bash. So I use I have windows and on\\n9:26 these windows I still have bash right.\\n9:28 So this is how my terminal looks like.\\n9:31 So and the examples um I have I show\\n9:35 they are\\n9:38 um so most of the time actually we\\n9:39 suggest to use code spaces. This is the\\n9:42 environment uh that you can get for free\\n9:44 from GitHub and then you have a Linux\\n9:47 there. You have a Linux with Docker with\\n9:49 Python with everything you need. So it's\\n9:51 the simplest way to actually get the\\n9:53 environment is just get a code spaces\\n9:56 um and then you will not need to install\\n9:58 anything. So that that are the\\n10:00 prerequisites being able to\\n10:03 feeling comfortable with programming and\\n10:05 with command line\\n10:07 and don't forget that this course is an\\n10:09 engineering course. This is not a data\\n10:11 science course. So we will do a lot of\\n10:13 coding.\\n10:15 I have not worked with PyTorch and\\n10:17 TensorFlow before. Will this be a\\n10:19 problem when we start learning new\\n10:20 neural networks? No. So for everything\\n10:22 we show here, um we don't of course\\n10:26 expect you to know this uh prior to the\\n10:29 course. So we don't expect you to know\\n10:30 any machine learning. Uh we're here to\\n10:33 actually teach you machine learning. So\\n10:35 you're here to learn machine learning.\\n10:37 So that's why we start from like really\\n10:39 basic things and then progress to more\\n10:42 difficult ones. So you don't need to\\n10:44 know any scikitlearn. You will learn\\n10:46 psychit learn here. You do not need to\\n10:49 learn uh so for example here we teach\\n10:51 docker you don't need to have prior\\n10:54 experience with docker here we teach uh\\n10:56 we talk about virtual environments you\\n10:58 don't need to have this experience\\n11:00 working with virtual environments. So we\\n11:02 all um we teach all these things here\\n11:05 but of course if you already worked with\\n11:07 Python and know what virtual\\n11:08 environments are uh then good for you.\\n11:11 So then for you model number five will\\n11:13 be like the easiest\\n11:15 and same applies with uh deep learning.\\n11:18 So if you already used um PyTorch then\\n11:21 for you probably the module about deep\\n11:23 learning will be easy cuz if you use\\n11:26 PyTorch you probably know everything\\n11:28 already. So we um this is for people who\\n11:33 don't know PyTorch and TensorFlow.\\n11:37 Uh is ML zoom camp for people who want\\n11:40 to become data scientists or ML\\n11:41 engineers? Kind of both but targeted\\n11:43 more for ML engineers because we have a\\n11:46 lot of uh again let me open it a lot of\\n11:48 topics are engineering. So deployment uh\\n11:50 serverless kubernetes they are\\n11:51 engineering topics. Uh typically data\\n11:54 scientists they are exposed to these\\n11:56 things to small extent than uh than ML\\n12:00 engineers. uh that's why this is ML\\n12:02 engineering an ML engineering course and\\n12:04 then K surf uh yeah we don't really um\\n12:08 cover it here but this is also an\\n12:10 engineering topic so I think uh the\\n12:12 content is still useful but it's kind of\\n12:14 very outdated because these things\\n12:16 change very fast and I don't have\\n12:18 opportunity to keep it up to date every\\n12:20 year but anyways um so we have a lot of\\n12:23 engineering topics so I I would say this\\n12:25 is more uh g this is more tailored to\\n12:30 um those who want to become MEL\\n12:31 engineers but data scientists will also\\n12:34 um find it useful. Many data scientists\\n12:36 said okay yeah like I already knew um\\n12:40 like I know module number one 2 4 6 8\\n12:45 this was already like I already knew\\n12:47 things but module five uh 9 and 10 were\\n12:51 super useful.\\n12:53 So for data scientists this information\\n12:55 is useful and when I was a data\\n12:57 scientist for me knowing how to deploy\\n12:59 things were quite nice.\\n13:02 Is there a recommended companion book\\n13:04 for the course? Yes. Uh so actually this\\n13:08 course is based on a book I wrote\\n13:10 machine learning\\n13:12 book amp.\\n13:15 So this is the book\\n13:17 website. Uh I think I can share it here.\\n13:23 Yeah. And then let me put it also here.\\n13:30 So this course is based on the book. Uh\\n13:33 but the book was written more than 5\\n13:35 years ago or like it was finished around\\n13:38 uh maybe half a year before the course\\n13:40 or maybe a year before the course was\\n13:42 recorded. Um so yeah the some of the\\n13:47 some parts of the book are slightly\\n13:49 outdated. So this is what I'm going to\\n13:52 fix right now um with this course. In\\n13:55 this course we are reording some of the\\n13:56 materials. So because the book is\\n13:59 outdated you will find the examples you\\n14:01 have in this course uh before the\\n14:03 update. So we still use u flask there.\\n14:06 Instead of fast fast API for example we\\n14:08 use tensorflow there. Instead of\\n14:10 PyTorch, we use Python 3.7 maybe like a\\n14:15 relatively old uh Python instead of 3.13\\n14:19 and so on. But um the the course is\\n14:22 largely based on the book and all the\\n14:24 examples we have here uh in this course\\n14:27 they are from the book. So yeah, this is\\n14:30 a recommended book uh for this course.\\n14:32 Yeah.\\n14:35 Do you need to have to learn any\\n14:37 prerequisites like math? Not\\n14:39 necessarily. Um, knowing linear algebra\\n14:41 will help. Um, but as I said, all the\\n14:44 linear algebra you need to know, I cover\\n14:47 here in this linear algebra uh unit.\\n14:52 Maybe you can check it right now to see\\n14:54 how much of this is still not clear\\n14:57 after you watch the videos. I try to\\n14:59 illustrate everything with u numpy. So\\n15:02 for me as a developer, seeing things in\\n15:05 code really helps. So maybe for you too.\\n15:08 So check it out and um\\n15:13 like if you understand what's happening\\n15:14 here then I think you're good uh to with\\n15:17 math when it comes to math. So you only\\n15:19 need um some basic linear algebra. We\\n15:23 use this linear algebra in module number\\n15:26 two when we implement linear regression\\n15:28 ourselves. But then starting from module\\n15:30 number three, we don't use any\\n15:32 mathematics at all cuz uh we start using\\n15:35 scikitlearn and uh scikitlearn\\n15:39 um implements everything we need right\\n15:41 so we don't really need to uh worry\\n15:43 about math right and then for you if\\n15:46 some things are difficult to understand\\n15:49 some theory cuz here like let's say when\\n15:52 I talk about linear regression\\n15:54 um yeah I use some formulas but if you\\n15:57 don't understand these formulas it's\\n15:58 fine and you can just implement what I\\n16:00 show and then move on. This is not\\n16:02 crucial for getting the most out of the\\n16:05 course. When you work as a data\\n16:07 scientist, knowing math will be\\n16:09 important. Knowing some linear algebra,\\n16:11 knowing some statistics will be\\n16:13 important. If you're going to work as a\\n16:15 machine learning engineer, these things\\n16:17 will be less important than for data\\n16:19 scientists because the focus for ML\\n16:21 engineers is more on the engineering\\n16:24 side rather than modeling side. Right?\\n16:27 So that's why um it's helpful to know\\n16:30 some mathematics uh but yeah not\\n16:32 strictly necessary and then these things\\n16:35 you can pick up as you uh go through the\\n16:38 course as you do projects or as you work\\n16:41 right so uh to answer your question no\\n16:45 stick prerequisites but some linear\\n16:47 algebra will be helpful maybe you can\\n16:49 check this uh unit I was talking about\\n16:51 right now and see if you need to pick up\\n16:53 anything but I don't expect any problems\\n16:55 like if you're uh an engineer, if you\\n16:58 know how to program, then for you this\\n17:00 is enough.\\n17:03 Do I need a efficient workstation? Like\\n17:06 probably asked you asked, do you need a\\n17:07 good computer to uh work on this um\\n17:10 course?\\n17:12 No. Um actually what you can use is um a\\n17:18 code space I think. Oh wait, I think\\n17:21 code spaces GitHub code spaces. If you\\n17:23 go to here environment here I show how\\n17:26 to um configure GitHub code spaces and\\n17:31 actually the environment you get there\\n17:33 for code spaces is relatively\\n17:37 is very not powerful it just have has\\n17:39 two CPUs and I don't know how I don't\\n17:41 remember how many how much RAM but yeah\\n17:44 this is not um very powerful um so then\\n17:48 what you need to have is just a computer\\n17:51 with Python\\n17:53 or computer with internet if you don't\\n17:55 if you cannot install some things or\\n17:57 maybe you I know some students uh from\\n17:59 Nigeria uh that we have that we had in\\n18:02 the past they didn't even have a\\n18:04 computer they just had a tablet they\\n18:08 could still finish the course so they\\n18:10 could use um this code spaces they could\\n18:13 connect to code spaces from their tablet\\n18:15 and then they could program everything\\n18:18 they needed um I think they had some\\n18:20 external\\n18:21 um keyboard board. But anyways, like all\\n18:24 you need is motivation to finish. Um,\\n18:27 and internet. Yeah, internet is also\\n18:29 important.\\n18:30 Can we use chip or other lamps? Yeah,\\n18:33 you can like I I would actually\\n18:35 recommend using them every time you see\\n18:37 a piece of code you don't understand.\\n18:39 You just copy it to charge and ask it to\\n18:42 explain. And that works really well cuz\\n18:45 you can uh if you still don't understand\\n18:48 some of the explanations, you can\\n18:49 continue uh you can keep asking it until\\n18:51 you understand. So this is really good.\\n18:54 I do recommend to use chbpt for\\n18:56 everything, not just common uh lines in\\n18:58 Python, for all the things uh that in\\n19:01 the course. I recommend using it because\\n19:04 for me it helps me personally\\n19:06 tremendously for not just courses but\\n19:09 also for other things that I learn for\\n19:11 other things that I explore or my\\n19:14 interests. So I recommend that you use\\n19:16 it too.\\n19:19 Um\\n19:21 uh yeah I think I answered this question\\n19:23 about prerequisites\\n19:26 is the zoom cup will be helpful to\\n19:28 target these roles ML ops or AI platform\\n19:31 engineering data infrastructure cloud\\n19:33 and engineer infrastructure engineer oh\\n19:35 yeah you have quite a lot of things uh I\\n19:37 don't think this zoom camp will be\\n19:39 helpful for any of those roles so for\\n19:42 mlops um so what we have we also have a\\n19:46 course called emlops zoom\\n19:49 So let me share this link with you if\\n19:51 you're interested. So we have this\\n19:53 course but for me this MLOps course is\\n19:56 just a so let's say this one is more for\\n19:59 beginner ML engineers and MLOps course\\n20:02 is more like intermediate ML engineers.\\n20:04 So it's still about ML engineering. So\\n20:06 we don't really talk about um you know\\n20:10 classical ops uh in terms of DevOps uh\\n20:13 but we show how to streamline uh\\n20:16 operations right. Right. So this is what\\n20:17 envelops is about like how to automate\\n20:20 some things. Uh so this uh neither of\\n20:24 these courses is good for cloud\\n20:26 engineers or data infrastructure\\n20:28 engineers or\\n20:30 yeah like any infrastructure engineers\\n20:32 or uh DevOps in general but these two\\n20:36 courses will teach you how to become a\\n20:38 good ML engineer. Um now I don't know\\n20:40 what exactly you mean by MLOps because\\n20:43 people may mean different things by this\\n20:46 but yeah so this is for ML engineering.\\n20:52 Uh for data engineering uh do you\\n20:54 recommend taking this course depends on\\n20:56 your goals. If your goal is to learn\\n20:58 data engineering then no I do not\\n21:00 recommend. If you're a data engineer who\\n21:02 work with machine learners, machine\\n21:04 learning engineers and with data\\n21:06 scientists and you want to understand\\n21:08 what what is happening, what they are\\n21:09 doing, this course will be very helpful.\\n21:12 When it comes to data engineering, we\\n21:13 actually have a course called data\\n21:15 engineering zoom camp that is focused\\n21:17 specifically on data engineering. So\\n21:20 this is what you should take instead if\\n21:22 you are interested in data engineering.\\n21:24 So this course will be tangentally\\n21:26 useful just to broaden your horizons. Uh\\n21:30 if you work with ML teams uh yes it will\\n21:33 be helpful to understand what they are\\n21:35 doing but for you as data engineer for\\n21:38 your career uh unless you plan to work\\n21:42 with ML it will not be very useful.\\n21:49 Please explain what jobs are suitable\\n21:50 for each course in Zoom camp. Okay,\\n21:53 let's try\\n21:55 now we have courses.\\n22:03 So these are the courses. So the courses\\n22:05 we have MLOps zoom camp, data engineer\\n22:08 zoom camp, machine learning zoom camp,\\n22:09 llm zoom camp. So ML uh ML zoom camp\\n22:14 this course is for ML engineers and data\\n22:17 scientists.\\n22:18 Um MLOps uh zoom camp is for ML\\n22:21 engineers again slightly more advanced\\n22:23 course than this one. Um so there is\\n22:26 also a role called MLOps engineer but it\\n22:29 may mean very different things for\\n22:31 different companies. So\\n22:34 um yeah we teach some uh automation some\\n22:37 things like that like make files and so\\n22:39 on. Um but yeah so in some cases MLOps\\n22:43 engineer is somebody who builds platform\\n22:46 for ML engineers then this is not about\\n22:48 building platform but it will it talks\\n22:50 about different steps and procedures of\\n22:53 the ML process. Uh data engineer zoom\\n22:57 camp is of course for data engineers uh\\n22:59 also for data scientists who want to\\n23:01 become better at building pipelines and\\n23:03 then LM zoom camp is for AI engineers\\n23:06 and data scientists. Then we also have\\n23:08 analytics and stock market zoom camp.\\n23:10 This is not a course I teach. So this is\\n23:13 uh this is done by Ivan who's u like\\n23:16 who's leading the course. Um so for him\\n23:19 uh the for his course the target\\n23:22 audience like it's for people who want\\n23:24 to build um who want to trade and who\\n23:26 want to build tools for trading.\\n23:30 Um then we also have a AI dev tools zoom\\n23:34 camp which is not here yet because this\\n23:35 is still work in progress. This is\\n23:38 course for engineers who want to use AI\\n23:40 to become uh more proficient.\\n23:44 Okay, let me share this link too.\\n23:50 Okay, I think I was answering this\\n23:52 question.\\n23:55 Now, are you going to teach something\\n23:56 new this time or we just have to watch\\n23:59 old videos? Um, I think I explained it.\\n24:03 uh yes you'll have to watch old videos\\n24:05 but there is also new material so I uh\\n24:08 this year I am updating some of the uh\\n24:12 things some of the modules so you will\\n24:14 have to watch well I don't like to say\\n24:17 have to nobody's forcing you but if you\\n24:20 wish to learn something you can decide\\n24:23 to watch all videos yes but uh trust me\\n24:27 these videos are going to be very useful\\n24:28 to you um as they have been very useful\\n24:32 to many people before you. Uh but also\\n24:36 yeah there will be new things too.\\n24:40 Uh what do you recommend for taking the\\n24:42 course for the official repo and working\\n24:45 or uh I would recommend creating a new\\n24:48 one and adding I think maybe I do have\\n24:52 examples here. Yeah, I would recommend\\n24:54 to create a separate repo and then put\\n24:57 all your homeworks there. um put your uh\\n25:00 for projects I would recommend for each\\n25:02 project to create a several ripple\\n25:06 I don't have any programming skill would\\n25:08 it be a challenge yes it will be a\\n25:10 challenge but there are some people who\\n25:13 finish the course despite that it just\\n25:15 depends on how it just depends on your\\n25:17 motivation how much time you have how\\n25:20 much extra you're willing to learn cuz\\n25:22 you will need to learn a lot so it will\\n25:24 not be easy it will be very difficult so\\n25:27 it will be a challenge but still you can\\n25:29 overcome this challenge. If you're\\n25:30 motivated, if you want to get into\\n25:32 machine learning and if you want to get\\n25:33 into machine learning, you have to learn\\n25:35 programming. So, it doesn't matter if\\n25:38 you want to become a data scientist or a\\n25:39 male engineer, you will have to learn\\n25:41 programming. So, there's no way around\\n25:43 that. So, better start earlier, sooner\\n25:45 than later. So, you can start now.\\n25:49 Uh the end of the cohort, what level of\\n25:52 machine learning mastery will we have\\n25:54 reached? Um depends how you measure it.\\n25:58 So what I wanted to cover in this course\\n25:59 is the 20% that will give you 80% of the\\n26:03 results right but still there is much\\n26:06 much much more out there that you need\\n26:09 to\\n26:11 um learn. So let's say after finishing\\n26:13 this course you will not be able to win\\n26:15 a Kaggle competition but after finishing\\n26:18 this course you will be able to put an\\n26:20 end to end machine learning project. So\\n26:23 um I don't know get a data set um\\n26:30 decide what kind of model you want to\\n26:31 train train this model and then serve\\n26:34 this model. So it will be an end to- end\\n26:37 project that you will be able to\\n26:38 accomplish which is enough to get hired\\n26:40 but this is uh in no way um\\n26:45 how to say mastery right so the path to\\n26:48 mastery is very long and will require a\\n26:51 lot of work so you will not be a senior\\n26:53 ML engineer by the end of by the end you\\n26:56 finish by the time you finish the course\\n26:58 but uh you'll have enough knowledge to\\n27:00 be an entry- level ML engineer\\n27:03 um Yeah. So, you'll be able to\\n27:06 independently create some things.\\n27:09 Will we have any certificates to put on\\n27:11 LinkedIn? Yes, you will. I think we even\\n27:14 have an example. Do we? Let me check.\\n27:19 Uh\\n27:21 yeah, actually we have uh like if you go\\n27:23 to the articles,\\n27:25 we have some success stories from\\n27:27 previous uh students.\\n27:30 Um does he share his certificate?\\n27:35 Yeah, this is the model he built\\n27:42 now. So\\n27:45 what I will do is I will just share\\n27:47 these articles with you and you can\\n27:49 check them out.\\n27:53 I see that there are some questions in\\n27:54 the chat. So, it's better to use the\\n27:57 slider link cuz for me it's very\\n27:59 difficult to\\n28:01 keep track of the questions in the live\\n28:04 chat. So, let's see here. Do we have\\n28:13 I think we somewhere had an example of a\\n28:16 certificate but yeah there will be a\\n28:18 certificate. So I just wanted to show it\\n28:21 but uh I don't think I can easily buy Oh\\n28:24 actually I think I can\\n28:28 so certificates.\\n28:33 Yeah, here is an example. So this is how\\n28:36 certificates will look like. So this is\\n28:38 something you can upload to LinkedIn and\\n28:40 we actually have instructions of how you\\n28:44 can add this to LinkedIn.\\n28:52 What does life cohort look like? Are\\n28:54 there any deadlines? Yes. Um so the um\\n28:59 we do this everything in a live cohort.\\n29:01 There are deadlines. So um this is uh\\n29:06 the platform we are going to use for\\n29:08 learning.\\n29:10 And let's take a look at the last year.\\n29:14 So you see we have homework and then we\\n29:16 have deadline for this homework right\\n29:18 for each homework we have deadlines you\\n29:20 have to finish the homework before the\\n29:22 deadline and all the interactions happen\\n29:26 in slack so in slack there are other\\n29:28 fellow learners with who you can\\n29:30 interact uh also the course instructors\\n29:32 are there in slack so we help you too\\n29:35 but mostly you interact with other\\n29:37 learners um and yeah so every week or\\n29:42 sometimes for some modules we have two\\n29:44 weeks uh per model. Just a second.\\n29:49 For some weeks we have two weeks per\\n29:51 model. For some uh for some modules we\\n29:54 have one week per module. Um and then\\n29:57 everyone works at the same time at the\\n29:59 same thing. Right? So that's the main\\n30:01 idea. Then um last year we also had a\\n30:04 competition a competition on Kaggle. So\\n30:07 this year we might have something too.\\n30:10 And then also projects are here. So\\n30:12 everything uh we work on is here on this\\n30:15 platform and yeah we have some deadlines\\n30:17 after the deadline passed you will not\\n30:20 be able to submit the homework. So\\n30:21 usually after the deadline we score all\\n30:24 the homeworks we publish the solutions\\n30:27 that's why after the deadline once the\\n30:28 solutions are published it doesn't make\\n30:30 sense to actually keep it open right\\n30:32 because you can see the solutions and\\n30:34 simply copy it. So yeah, so there are\\n30:36 deadlines to keep you to help you um um\\n30:41 with um sticking to the schedule. Then\\n30:43 we also have a leaderboard where I think\\n30:46 Alexander this is the person who wrote\\n30:50 uh this article, right? It's actually he\\n30:53 wrote too. Cool. Um so uh yeah we have\\n30:58 this uh leaderboard\\n31:00 and then uh you get points by um solving\\n31:03 homeworks correctly and by sharing your\\n31:05 progress in public. So we encourage\\n31:07 learning in public. Um yeah we will talk\\n31:10 about this more on the course lounge.\\n31:12 But we encourage everything you learn to\\n31:15 uh to share in public. And I I think I\\n31:20 can um also share this thing. Do I have\\n31:23 the same thing? Oh,\\n31:26 so just yesterday I interviewed one of\\n31:28 the students uh pastor. So pastor\\n31:32 um\\n31:34 he finished first on the leaderboard I\\n31:38 think it was two years ago. So he shares\\n31:41 his experience\\n31:43 and also how public learning helped him.\\n31:46 So I think this is a really cool\\n31:48 episode, really cool interview. I will\\n31:52 share it with you. Uh and then um\\n31:57 inter\\n31:59 view with pastor.\\n32:05 So many good things happened to pastor\\n32:07 after he shared the the learning after\\n32:10 he learned in public. So uh we encourage\\n32:14 you to do this and then we have this\\n32:15 leaderboard.\\n32:17 Okay.\\n32:19 So yeah, once the course starts, you\\n32:21 will have um these lessons with\\n32:24 deadlines. Uh these deadlines will\\n32:27 change as we go along the course because\\n32:29 some things happen. Um sometimes there\\n32:32 are delays. Uh yeah, but at the\\n32:34 beginning we give you a rough uh\\n32:36 schedule. So then you can some do some\\n32:39 planning. Are there zoom lectures or\\n32:41 live sessions on YouTube and learning\\n32:43 while learning and what time? So all the\\n32:46 things are pre-recorded. We will have\\n32:48 one live stream for the launch and\\n32:51 that's it. So we used to have um we used\\n32:55 to have office hours. Right now I don't\\n32:58 see any point in uh doing these office\\n33:01 hours cuz we have done these office\\n33:03 hours in the past. All the questions\\n33:06 that people had I answered. So you can\\n33:08 just rewatch the old office hours\\n33:10 videos. Uh so there will be no live\\n33:12 sessions. Um,\\n33:15 you just watch pre-recorded videos and\\n33:18 then you interact with others in Slack.\\n33:22 Uh, yeah, I think I just answered that.\\n33:27 Is it best to use a Kaggle data set or\\n33:28 to find one ourselves? Is it a question\\n33:30 about the project? Um,\\n33:34 like Kaggle is a good platform for data\\n33:37 sets, but it's not the only source. You\\n33:38 can find data sets in other places too.\\n33:42 So,\\n33:45 It doesn't matter actually. I answered\\n33:48 that question. Would you do a data\\n33:50 science to camp? No. Uh I mean this one\\n33:54 is kind of data scienceish\\n33:57 cuz uh if we look at the\\n34:03 syllabus,\\n34:04 we have uh one, two, three, four, five,\\n34:09 six modules.\\n34:12 Did I correctly? One, two, three, four,\\n34:15 five, six. Yeah,\\n34:19 six modules or seven uh that are about\\n34:21 data science. I think that's enough.\\n34:23 Yeah, I don't see a point in creating\\n34:26 another course just for that. So, it\\n34:28 will be like the same material.\\n34:32 Uh will we will we deploy ML models\\n34:35 locally or use remote environment both?\\n34:38 Um actually for the course uh for the\\n34:40 project of the course you will get extra\\n34:43 point if you deploy to the cloud uh but\\n34:46 also I know some of you cannot um for\\n34:49 whatever reasons um\\n34:52 do the cloud thing then you can just\\n34:55 deploy locally you will just get fewer\\n34:57 points but we do show how to deploy to\\n34:59 the cloud not just locally.\\n35:03 I am a data engineer and I want to\\n35:05 become a male engineer. Will this course\\n35:06 help? If yes, how much? Yes, it will.\\n35:09 Um, I don't know how to answer the\\n35:11 second like very much.\\n35:14 Yeah, well, it will help you. Yeah. Um,\\n35:17 what is the better job for the future?\\n35:19 Data engineer, data scientist or\\n35:22 how do you measure better like um um the\\n35:27 way I would rephrase it, what is the\\n35:29 better job for me in the future? Do I\\n35:32 enjoy doing data engineering, data\\n35:34 science or machine learning? So once you\\n35:36 have the answer then you have the answer\\n35:38 for this question cuz the the point is\\n35:41 to do what you enjoy most like if let's\\n35:44 say somebody says oh yeah data engineers\\n35:47 are more in more demand cuz there are\\n35:49 more vacancies but then you hate data\\n35:51 engineering you don't like it like so\\n35:53 does it mean you have to do it or maybe\\n35:56 there are fewer ML engineering jobs but\\n35:58 you just like it more so then just go\\n36:00 with this so\\n36:03 yeah and then who knows maybe AI will\\n36:05 replace all of them. So\\n36:09 yeah, I'm I'm joking. I don't think it\\n36:10 will replace but um yeah, in terms of\\n36:14 better like you define better and then\\n36:18 yeah, you just select it for yourself.\\n36:22 Is there a leaderboard? Yeah, we talked\\n36:24 about the leaderboard.\\n36:26 Will anyone with zero technical\\n36:28 background\\n36:29 uh where is Hendrick to get this? Yeah,\\n36:32 I I think I answered that. So if you\\n36:34 have the motivation, if you have the\\n36:36 time and if you're willing to put the\\n36:38 time and energy into this then you will\\n36:40 be able to finish.\\n36:44 Uh so there will be three projects and\\n36:48 in order to get a certificate you will\\n36:50 need to finish two out of three at\\n36:52 least. So you can finish three of course\\n36:54 but you need to finish at least two. So\\n36:56 it will be a midterm project and uh so\\n36:59 midterm project will happen between um\\n37:03 let me check\\n37:05 uh yeah so you see we have module number\\n37:07 six and then module number eight so we\\n37:09 kind of jump so there is no module\\n37:10 number seven so what happens here is the\\n37:13 midterm project and then we will also\\n37:16 have after the Kubernetes module we will\\n37:18 have two more projects so out of these\\n37:20 three projects you will need to finish\\n37:23 two\\n37:25 uh what the prerequisites we talked\\n37:27 about what is the weekly time\\n37:28 commitment. So it really depends on your\\n37:30 background but we have some numbers from\\n37:34 the past. So you can see you can go to\\n37:37 any homework and see homework statistics\\n37:39 and then you can see how much time\\n37:41 people spend on this. So on average\\n37:44 people spend 4 hours watching lectures\\n37:48 and 2 hours watching or doing the\\n37:50 homework. So it probably means that the\\n37:53 homework was too simple and this year we\\n37:55 need to make it more complex, right?\\n37:58 But of course uh yeah it all depends on\\n38:00 your\\n38:02 background. So for most people it was\\n38:06 easy or I mean it was just 6 hours and\\n38:09 this module lasted two weeks. I don't\\n38:11 think it's a lot of time.\\n38:14 Uh but then let's say take is deploying\\n38:19 see statistics. Yeah, this one is uh\\n38:22 wait time spent.\\n38:26 Yeah, so people spend more time watching\\n38:28 lectures here and more time on homework.\\n38:31 So this one was more difficult. So you\\n38:33 can do this uh for um projects. I still\\n38:37 need to implement the dashboard like\\n38:38 that. Uh the data is there. I just need\\n38:40 to build the page. Uh maybe I just\\n38:42 should just use cursor for that. The d\\n38:45 is there. I just need to um visualize\\n38:48 visualize it. So what I what I want to\\n38:50 have is a dashboard for all the\\n38:53 homeworks and projects on one page. And\\n38:56 by the way, if you want to help with uh\\n38:59 this uh this actually is a jungle\\n39:01 project. So all of that is open source.\\n39:04 And uh yeah, if you have some free time\\n39:07 and you want to help with uh some of\\n39:10 these things, uh your contributions are\\n39:12 welcome. Uh please reach to me in Slack\\n39:14 first. Uh if you want to do something,\\n39:17 don't just open a PR. Um then we discuss\\n39:20 what's the best way of implementing this\\n39:22 then you go ahead and implement um yeah\\n39:24 that's also possible but um if no one\\n39:27 volunteers eventually I want to\\n39:29 implement this one dashboard that shows\\n39:31 the effort you need to put for all the\\n39:34 homeworks and the projects too. So uh\\n39:37 but speaking of the projects I think\\n39:38 it's uh 10 to 20 10 to 20 hours of work\\n39:43 to do the project. So let's say 10 per\\n39:47 week would be a nice estimate uh upper\\n39:50 uh estimate\\n39:53 from five five to 10. Will the capstone\\n39:56 projects be something we can use in our\\n39:57 portfolio to show recruiters or hiring\\n39:59 green managers? Yes. Yes, definitely.\\n40:01 And I was talking about this video with\\n40:03 pastor. So he finished was it three\\n40:06 years ago? Um but he says he still uses\\n40:10 his uh three projects. So he completed\\n40:13 um u the midterm at two capstones and he\\n40:16 still uses these projects uh when he\\n40:18 talks to clients. So he works as a\\n40:20 freelancer and then he has his portfolio\\n40:22 and then he shows that uh to people\\n40:25 still shows this. So yes definitely and\\n40:28 this is the intention. So the intention\\n40:30 we have for you when you uh build your\\n40:34 projects for the course think of these\\n40:38 projects not as projects that you do it\\n40:40 for the course but the projects you do\\n40:42 for yourself for your project portfolio\\n40:44 and for the hiring managers. So think\\n40:46 that it's not only uh your peer students\\n40:50 who will evaluate these projects but\\n40:52 also eventually it will be a hiring\\n40:54 manager who will look at the projects.\\n40:56 So keep this in mind when you work on\\n40:58 the projects and then you will have very\\n41:00 nice additions to your project\\n41:01 portfolio.\\n41:04 Uh do you set up an environment for\\n41:06 deploying the models? Uh in a couple of\\n41:08 phrases, how is deployment going to look\\n41:10 like? Um so deployment. Okay. So first\\n41:14 of all, the environment for training for\\n41:17 the course is as I said it's a Linux\\n41:19 environment. Uh the recommended\\n41:20 environment wait I I think I might be\\n41:23 confusing you. So you can you can work\\n41:25 anywhere you want. Could be your laptop,\\n41:28 could be um a machine you rent on the\\n41:31 cloud. The recommended environment is\\n41:33 GitHub code spaces. When you use GitHub\\n41:35 code spaces, you get a Linux machine.\\n41:37 It's a Debian based Linux. So things\\n41:39 like app get work there. You have Docker\\n41:41 there. Um so this is the environment uh\\n41:44 we recommend to use for learning.\\n41:47 Then at some point it's module five\\n41:50 where we will talk about virtual uh\\n41:52 environments and uh containerization and\\n41:55 deployment. We will introduce tools like\\n41:57 uh UV like docker um like in the\\n42:01 workshop we used fly io for deploying or\\n42:05 in the model we used elastic bins. There\\n42:07 are also many many other ways to deploy\\n42:09 your models. Then it's up to you to\\n42:11 decide how where you want to deploy. But\\n42:14 the main part here is containerization\\n42:17 uh which we do with docker and uh yeah\\n42:20 so that's the main kind of environment I\\n42:24 guess uh but yeah so then um also we\\n42:28 talk a lot about um\\n42:32 we have a module on serverless where we\\n42:34 show how to do how to do deployment with\\n42:36 AWS Lambda and we talk about Kubernetes\\n42:38 where we show how to do deployment with\\n42:40 Kubernetes. So once you have once you\\n42:43 package things in your Docker container,\\n42:45 you can deploy it virtually everywhere\\n42:47 anywhere you want, right? Fly IO, uh AWS\\n42:51 services, Kubernetes, whatever.\\n42:58 Okay.\\n43:04 Will we learn how to handle ML model\\n43:06 monitoring and model retraining\\n43:08 workflows like in production systems?\\n43:10 No. This is something you we cover in\\n43:13 MLOps zoom camp not in this one.\\n43:18 Uh will taking the course be useful for\\n43:20 aspiring data engineers? I think I\\n43:22 answered this questions. Um so if your\\n43:25 goal is to become a data engineer, this\\n43:27 course will not be useful. So this\\n43:29 course is for ML engineers well not for\\n43:31 data engineers.\\n43:33 Why do we get more points if we deploy\\n43:34 the model to the cloud? Cuz um this is\\n43:37 extra work, right? If you don't deploy,\\n43:40 you don't get points. If you deploy, you\\n43:42 get points. That's it.\\n43:45 Um, Al, hi Al. I'm an engineering\\n43:49 manager for some years in classical\\n43:50 system building. Would you recommend\\n43:52 this course for me? Well, Al, I need to\\n43:54 know a little more about you to say if I\\n43:56 can recommend this course to you. Uh,\\n43:59 the question I have to you is if you're\\n44:01 interested in machine learning. If the\\n44:03 answer is yes, then I definitely can\\n44:05 recommend this course. If the answer is\\n44:06 no, I don't know what you're doing here.\\n44:10 How often are live sessions and what's a\\n44:12 typical schedule this week? So, we don't\\n44:14 have live section live sessions. We only\\n44:16 have pre-recorded. Well, when I say we\\n44:19 don't, it doesn't mean we don't have\\n44:21 them at all because right now is last\\n44:23 live session, right? We will have\\n44:25 another one when the course when we\\n44:28 launch the course, but that will be the\\n44:30 only one. Uh I don't think we I I don't\\n44:33 plan any other live sessions. Um uh will\\n44:37 there will be some um workshops too\\n44:39 because I want to update some of the\\n44:42 modules but there will be separate\\n44:44 announcements. Uh most of the material\\n44:46 is pre-recorded so uh you just watch\\n44:49 those. So yeah\\n44:52 uh I will do a live session on\\n44:54 Kubernetes and a live session on PyTorch\\n44:57 and these live sessions become the\\n44:59 course materials. So next year when we\\n45:02 um launch the sixth cohort of this\\n45:04 course, I will simply use the materials\\n45:07 I record now as a part of live session\\n45:09 in the cohort. So they will be you can\\n45:11 just treat them as pre-recorded cuz this\\n45:14 this um what did I\\n45:18 say I shared this workshop right on UV\\n45:20 and fast API. So this was a live session\\n45:23 but I will simply include the recording\\n45:25 of the live session into course\\n45:27 materials and say yeah these are the\\n45:28 course materials and this will be like\\n45:30 pre-recorded because I already recorded\\n45:32 the live session\\n45:37 frequency of I think I already answered\\n45:39 this.\\n45:42 Um can we catch up later if we miss a\\n45:44 day? Yes. Um like all the the things are\\n45:47 pre-recorded and you just follow these\\n45:50 things. So you go let's say module\\n45:51 number one you go unit number one there\\n45:54 is a video you watch it if you have\\n45:57 questions you ask them in slack and\\n46:00 there will be\\n46:03 this cohorts folder like I will create\\n46:06 2025 here\\n46:08 um maybe I will do this right after this\\n46:10 workshop but I definitely do it before\\n46:12 we have the launch stream so this is how\\n46:15 it looked the last year so there are\\n46:17 some specific things for um the past\\n46:21 cohort in particular it was the\\n46:24 homework. So you follow the videos and\\n46:25 at the end there is a homework you do\\n46:28 the homework you submit the homework and\\n46:30 that's your plan for one module then you\\n46:33 repeat it for the next one and so on. So\\n46:36 really simple I think and then you can\\n46:38 work at this any time you want so you're\\n46:40 not restricted to any particular time\\n46:42 slot.\\n46:45 If I'm a data engineer and I also love\\n46:47 mathematics is MLE for me I think I like\\n46:49 MLE because of the idea that I can do\\n46:51 will do a lot of math. So I have to\\n46:54 disappoint you MLE do not really work\\n46:57 with a lot of math. Um I don't think MLE\\n47:01 is do any math at all. Um and so if you\\n47:07 want to do modeling I think it's more\\n47:08 like a data scientist role rather than\\n47:10 ML engineering role. ML engineers\\n47:13 typically are more focused on the\\n47:15 engineering side rather than modeling\\n47:17 side. Of course, there are companies\\n47:19 where um you need to do everything\\n47:22 starting from modeling and then um\\n47:24 deploy.\\n47:26 But um\\n47:28 yeah, typically there is some how to say\\n47:32 role separation. So data scientists\\n47:34 they're a bit more uh math inclined\\n47:37 let's say and ML engineers they're more\\n47:40 engineering inclined.\\n47:42 um doesn't mean there these roles are\\n47:44 set in stone. Um I know some ML\\n47:47 engineers who are pretty good at\\n47:48 modeling. So they do this. Uh the reason\\n47:51 I the reason we have these modules here\\n47:55 cuz I think this is still important for\\n47:57 ML engineers to be able to create a\\n47:59 simple model. Uh but you will not as I\\n48:02 said you will not win a Kaggle\\n48:04 competition with this knowledge. Right?\\n48:05 So these are pretty basics. Um so I have\\n48:09 to disappoint you here. here we don't\\n48:11 really have a lot of math\\n48:15 but also as a data scientist I didn't\\n48:17 need to really use a lot of math to be\\n48:20 honest\\n48:23 how we should balance learning uh the\\n48:25 tools versus understanding the core\\n48:27 concepts\\n48:28 what should come first in practice\\n48:31 so for me uh I was an engineer I used to\\n48:35 work as a dove developer and then I\\n48:36 switched to machine learning the way I\\n48:39 did this the way I structured My\\n48:41 learning was on by doing projects. So I\\n48:45 had a project in mind and then I learned\\n48:48 just enough to deliver this project and\\n48:50 then sometimes some things were\\n48:52 interesting for me so I would dig deeper\\n48:54 into some of the topics. But for me as\\n48:57 an engineer the approach of focusing the\\n49:01 project of having an end in mind really\\n49:04 helped to stay focused and this is the\\n49:06 approach we use here in the course. So\\n49:08 here um let's say for this\\n49:12 for this the third uh module uh the\\n49:15 problem we have is term prediction right\\n49:18 so there are some people we are working\\n49:21 in a telecom company there are some\\n49:24 people who canceling their contract with\\n49:26 the company with our company so we want\\n49:28 to detect u people who are about to\\n49:30 cancel and prevent them from doing this\\n49:32 so we want to send them an a promotional\\n49:35 email saying hey uh like here's a\\n49:38 discount don't please don't go. Um so in\\n49:40 hope that we will retain these\\n49:42 customers. So here's the project\\n49:45 description and we cover just enough\\n49:48 theory\\n49:50 to\\n49:52 finish the project right and you don't\\n49:54 need more and this project based\\n49:55 learning I think it's the best um\\n49:58 learning because otherwise you risk of\\n50:01 going too deep into some things and\\n50:05 spend too much time on that. So this is\\n50:08 how I think you should balance learning.\\n50:10 So you kind of need both tools and\\n50:12 understanding the core ML concepts but\\n50:14 you need just enough to reach the goal\\n50:16 you have in mind but then you do this\\n50:19 you complete the project and you have\\n50:20 another project and then you kind of\\n50:23 continue right um for me also Kaggle\\n50:27 helped. So on Kaggle uh the goal was to\\n50:30 compete in the in a competition right to\\n50:32 have a good model and then for that I\\n50:34 needed to learn things and because um\\n50:37 you also have a job so you cannot spend\\n50:40 a lot of time on Kaggle so your time is\\n50:41 restricted and you try to do okay what\\n50:44 is the most efficient use of my time\\n50:47 right so for me it was personally it for\\n50:49 me personally it was super helpful to uh\\n50:52 and there I also balanced learning the\\n50:55 tools versus understanding the corl\\n50:57 concept cuz I was really focusing on the\\n50:59 competition.\\n51:02 Uh both homeworks and projects are\\n51:03 mandatory to receive the certificate.\\n51:05 No. Uh so only projects are mandatory\\n51:08 for the certificates. The homeworks are\\n51:10 not. It's up to you if you want to spend\\n51:12 time on them or not. Um the homeworks\\n51:16 are graded automatically. So the\\n51:18 homeworks\\n51:20 they're typically multiple choice\\n51:21 questions. So this is how they or\\n51:23 sometimes you need to put something um\\n51:26 but more often than not it's multiple\\n51:28 choice questions. So you just uh do what\\n51:30 we ask. So here this is how homeworks\\n51:32 looks like. So you just need to install\\n51:35 pandas and then we ask what is the\\n51:37 version or uh you get some data and you\\n51:40 need count records or uh do some\\n51:43 exploratory data analysis in this\\n51:45 particular case right and then you\\n51:46 submit these things and because there is\\n51:49 only one or two correct answers. This is\\n51:52 graded automatically but we try to make\\n51:55 this homeworks\\n51:57 interesting enough so it's interesting\\n51:59 for you and easier for us to grade.\\n52:01 Right? So that's um when it comes to\\n52:04 homeworks or\\n52:07 uh midterm projects you need to evaluate\\n52:11 u so you you\\n52:14 deliver a project. So there are some\\n52:16 criteria you need to satisfy. So these\\n52:19 are the criteria problem description\\n52:21 exploratory data analysis model training\\n52:23 and so on.\\n52:25 And then you also need to evaluate your\\n52:26 peers and then at the end you get a\\n52:28 report. So some Peters some of the peers\\n52:30 they say um they give you feedback. So\\n52:32 this is the feedback I got but the\\n52:34 project I submitted was a fake course\\n52:37 project. So there was nothing that's why\\n52:41 I didn't get any points. Uh the reason I\\n52:44 got uh nine uh is uh cuz I evaluated\\n52:49 other peers. So that's why um like for\\n52:53 each evalation I get three points. But\\n52:55 this is how it's done. So the we\\n52:57 evaluate projects by doing peer review\\n52:59 and peer review is mandatory to complete\\n53:02 the project. So if you submit a project\\n53:04 but you don't do peer reviewing you fail\\n53:05 the project and if you fail a project\\n53:07 you fail the course. Right? So this very\\n53:09 important to do peer reviews.\\n53:13 Uh will the course make one job ready?\\n53:15 Yes. If you put effort in the the the\\n53:19 course and if you make a good project,\\n53:22 if you also follow our recommendations\\n53:25 to learn in public, this will definitely\\n53:28 make you job ready. Uh what's the next\\n53:30 path to follow after the completing the\\n53:32 course? Uh to step into advanced stuff,\\n53:35 find a job. That's the best way. Um cuz\\n53:39 you can do courses forever, but I think\\n53:41 you need to work on projects. This is\\n53:43 where the real experience comes from. So\\n53:46 you need to find something that is a\\n53:47 job. Maybe at the beginning could be\\n53:50 difficult but then find a volunteering\\n53:52 job. I don't know there are so many\\n53:54 places where you can volunteer. So put\\n53:56 your skills into practice and then by\\n53:58 doing this you will again do this\\n54:00 project based learning that I um talked\\n54:03 about and then it will force you to\\n54:05 learn new things in order to solve a\\n54:07 problem you have and then you build a\\n54:10 portfolio of things and then it will\\n54:12 make you even more job ready. Um yeah so\\n54:16 I wouldn't recommend taking another\\n54:18 course of course you can do a melops\\n54:20 course that we have you can find a lot\\n54:22 of courses like we have this page\\n54:25 yeah wait no not this one\\n54:30 23 free online courses on machine\\n54:33 learning so there are a lot of courses\\n54:35 not just our course there are so many\\n54:36 other courses but um I wouldn't\\n54:39 recommend to spend too much time on\\n54:42 learning things I would just say I mean\\n54:44 on learning through courses. Courses are\\n54:46 useful and important and for me\\n54:47 personally courses were super helpful in\\n54:50 my career but just don't do don't do\\n54:52 just courses right so I would suggest to\\n54:56 start involve being involved in\\n54:58 different projects as soon as possible.\\n55:04 Um you said the course videos are\\n55:06 pre-recorded so the ones already\\n55:07 available on the platform they will be\\n55:09 updated. Uh if not can we begin\\n55:11 accessing them beforehand? Yes, you can\\n55:13 access them beforehand. Um, only two\\n55:16 more modules will be updated.\\n55:19 Um, so\\n55:22 uh this one this this this will stay the\\n55:25 same. I'm not going to update them. This\\n55:27 one is already updated. I just need to\\n55:29 put this in the description. But this\\n55:30 one was the UV and fast API module uh\\n55:33 workshop. I'll just simply include the\\n55:36 link to the workshop here. That will be\\n55:38 all the update. So this is going to stay\\n55:40 the same. In this we will uh add extra\\n55:43 material on PyTorch. So the TensorFlow\\n55:45 part will stay the same. So what you can\\n55:47 do is now you go go through TensorFlow\\n55:49 part but then we will show how to do\\n55:51 exactly the same thing with uh PyTorch.\\n55:53 So we will not do any theory. We will\\n55:55 just do practice with PyTorch because\\n55:57 the theoretical part is recorded with\\n55:58 TensorFlow and it will stay the same.\\n56:00 This one is updated and this one is\\n56:02 going to be updated.\\n56:04 Uh some of the fundamentals are still\\n56:07 valid. It's just we are not going to use\\n56:09 TensorFlow serving. Um but yeah, you can\\n56:13 watch the course. Uh actually I think\\n56:16 TensorFlow serving is still good. So\\n56:18 yeah, we'll just need to use uh newer\\n56:21 versions. Uh but I also want to record\\n56:24 any some extra things here.\\n56:28 Uh some extra things here.\\n56:31 So you but um to answer your question\\n56:36 you can go ahead and watch the videos\\n56:37 right now. There will be some updates\\n56:40 but by watching the videos um so the\\n56:43 updates will be extra materials right so\\n56:45 you can already just watch what we have.\\n56:49 Would you do a math for AI zoom camp or\\n56:51 boot camp? No. Um detailed timeline. I\\n56:55 talked about this. We talked about this.\\n56:58 Um would you share any assignments or\\n57:00 problems after each module? Uh yes, we\\n57:03 have homework and we also have um like\\n57:08 solutions. We publish the solutions. If\\n57:11 I miss cohorts, will I not get the\\n57:13 certificate? Do you miss if you do you\\n57:16 mean if you miss uh a homework? If you\\n57:19 miss a homework, you will still get a\\n57:21 certificate. If you miss the entire\\n57:22 cohort, you will not get the\\n57:24 certificate, of course.\\n57:26 uh answered.\\n57:30 So the homeworks will be different but\\n57:32 you can check the past homeworks. Yeah.\\n57:35 Um\\n57:37 any resource tutorials to sharpen my\\n57:39 Python skills? Chad GPT is really good.\\n57:42 So just use CHP. Does the course cover\\n57:44 fundamental mathematics needed for\\n57:46 machine learning? No, we don't cover\\n57:48 these things. Just a little bit of\\n57:50 algebra.\\n57:52 I want to learn artificial intelligence,\\n57:54 machine learning. Um I think I answered\\n57:57 that question. You can see this from the\\n57:58 syllabus what we cover and what we\\n58:00 don't. This is not a replacement for\\n58:02 MLOps course. Um\\n58:05 uh answered\\n58:08 question from Alex. So maybe this is the\\n58:10 last question I'm going to take. How do\\n58:12 you maximize learning with LM? You let\\n58:14 it explain to you but take care to do\\n58:16 things that you're learning manually. So\\n58:19 the easiest way um you can do so let's\\n58:23 say uh there is um this piece of code\\n58:28 you don't understand uh let's see so\\n58:31 let's say you're struggling with docker\\n58:34 and then you don't understand what's\\n58:35 happening here so then what you can do\\n58:37 is you can copy paste these things to\\n58:39 chip and say hey please explain midline\\n58:41 by line what happens here and then\\n58:44 chaptt is doing quite a good job at that\\n58:48 So this is uh what I'm mean mostly but\\n58:52 uh I think it has this learning mode\\n58:55 that they published recently. Uh I\\n58:58 haven't experimented with that but\\n58:59 typically for me I just hey this is not\\n59:02 detailed enough.\\n59:04 I have an example actually from one of\\n59:06 the workshops I gave. So let's say this\\n59:10 coding agent. So in this um new workshop\\n59:13 I was showing how to create a Django\\n59:16 template even though like it wasn't\\n59:18 about Django. So, I didn't want to spend\\n59:21 time\\n59:22 uh on explaining jungle stuff.\\n59:27 And I think I just showed\\n59:32 where is it?\\n59:34 Think somewhere is a link\\n59:38 build from scratch.\\n59:45 Yeah. I don't know.\\n59:47 chat GPT\\n59:52 did I not post it? Okay, weird. Uh I\\n59:57 think it was a different document.\\n59:59 Anyways, um so what I did is I just um\\n1:00:03 posted where so all these things like\\n1:00:07 building the jungle app from scratch and\\n1:00:09 I just edited this copied this to jungo\\n1:00:14 and said hey this is the tutorial I\\n1:00:16 don't understand explain it line by line\\n1:00:18 and then it gave me some explanation but\\n1:00:20 I say okay this explanation is not\\n1:00:22 detailed enough I don't understand this\\n1:00:23 step and then it explained me this step\\n1:00:26 so this is how you can approach that Um\\n1:00:30 yeah, so I I need to run now. I have\\n1:00:32 another meeting right now. So um well I\\n1:00:35 still I I managed to answer quite a few\\n1:00:38 questions. So thanks a lot for\\n1:00:41 uh joining me today for asking your\\n1:00:43 questions. Uh this was an amazing\\n1:00:45 session. Thanks a lot for all these\\n1:00:47 questions. And what I can do is I still\\n1:00:50 see that there are some questions. You\\n1:00:51 can keep asking these questions and we\\n1:00:54 will cover uh these questions on our\\n1:00:56 next stream which will be um on\\n1:00:59 September 15th when we launch the\\n1:01:01 course. So there will be a section for\\n1:01:03 Q&A where I will continue answering the\\n1:01:06 questions you have. So if your question\\n1:01:08 was not answered um I'll try to address\\n1:01:13 this next time. So thanks a lot for\\n1:01:15 joining. You have to run now. Um, so\\n1:01:18 yeah, see you around and all the links\\n1:01:20 are in the description if you're\\n1:01:22 interested in enrolling into this\\n1:01:24 course. Um, yeah, there's a sign up\\n1:01:26 button. Click on that and you will\\n1:01:29 receive an email and we will start on\\n1:01:31 September 15th. So, bye everyone. See\\n1:01:34 you soon.\""

We\\'ll discuss going from\\n    bioinformatics to freelancing. We have a special guest today, Katya. As a freelancer\\n    Katya is helping companies bridge the gap between business and data by building\\n    actionable analytics and coaching the teams. She has a lot of broad experience\\n    in startups, entrepreneurship and scale-ups. Katya was head of analytics at Gitti,\\n    a beauty brand. She tried to start her own fintech business with Entrepreneur\\n    First and she worked as a data scientist at Zalando. Welcome to the show. It\\'s\\n    a pleasure to have you here.\\n  sec: 71\\n  time: \\'1:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, thank you so much for the invitation. It was really nice to catch up,\\n    actually. I think we\\'ve known each other for some time. I\\'m really happy to be\\n    here.\\n  sec: 112\\n  time: \\'1:52\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s background\\n- line: I tried to invite you multiple times. Finally, we managed to do this. [chuckles]\\n    Before we start with our main topic of being a data generalist, let\\'s start with\\n    your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?\\n  sec: 122\\n  time: \\'2:02\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Let me start a bit from the very beginning and jump to what is happening\\n    right now. I started, as Alex mentioned, as a bioinformatician – a Bachelor’s\\n    and Master\\'s degrees in bioinformatics. I worked in different research institutes\\n    across Europe, Manchester University, Charité here in Berlin, and also at the\\n    Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona. After getting my Master\\'s degree,\\n    I realized that I was not motivated that much by research.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s where I switched directly to a startup and was a first data hire there.\\n    I was hired as a data analyst, and I ended up doing a lot of the data engineering\\n    part, which I loved, but I didn\\'t enjoy it  that much, maybe. Then I switched\\n    to Zalando. I also was there at Zalando Payments, where I was building real-time\\n    machine learning systems for fraud prediction and payment scoring. Basically,\\n    when you shop on Zalando and you get an invoice and the payment method, that\\'s\\n    exactly my team who built the algorithm behind that, to enable you to buy with\\n    this payment method. It was a super-heavy engineering team, lots of PhD people\\n    and lots of young people – so really ambitious, really nice. That\\'s where all\\n    my engineering background comes from.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then, after two years there, I was a bit stuck regarding learning. That\\'s\\n    when a very good friend of mine said, “Hey, why don\\'t you start something?” and\\n    that\\'s when I went to Entrepreneur First. You can imagine that there\\'s a startup\\n    accelerator, founded in London, they have programs across the globe. Basically,\\n    it\\'s pre-team, pre-idea. You go there as an individual, you need to identify yourself\\n    as a CEO or a CTO, and then it\\'s kind of like speed dating – speed co-founding.\\n    [chuckles] I\\'m more on the CTO side (a technical person) so I was trying to find\\n    a CEO match.\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Basically, you work with one person, you match, and you work together for\\n    three days. Normally, after three days, you realize that either it’s going well\\n    or it’s not, because at the end of the day, startups fail because of the mismatch\\n    on founders. Within that program, I tried to found a fintech company, but I went\\n    really in a very different, weird segment – I went into compliance. It\\'s like\\n    the most unsexy and the most regulated thing ever. So I realized [cross-talk]\\n  sec: 135\\n  time: \\'2:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What is compliance?\\n  sec: 300\\n  time: \\'5:00\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Basically, it\\'s KYC – Know Your Customer – know your business. You need to\\n    do legal checks on the person –who you are as a person. Have you ever had bankruptcy?\\n    Are you associated with money laundering? Do you have a company that maybe was\\n    associated with money laundering? All those kinds of checks that, for instance,\\n    you also need to do when you open a bank account – then you do this postident\\n    thing. We went into the B2B “know your business” compliance part. After that,\\n    I realized that it was interesting, but… and we wanted to try to copycat an American\\n    startup, but it didn\\'t work here in Europe. Then Corona happened and I was really\\n    exhausted after almost six months of Entrepreneur First.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Really, seriously, I was not ready to found a company. It was like everybody\\n    around me were founding companies and I was like, “Okay, let me jump on that wave.”\\n    But internally and mentally and emotionally, I was not prepared. I would wake\\n    up two weeks in a row with that headache. That was already a sign that something\\n    was not going well. Then I joined Delivery Hero’s fintech department. And again,\\n    I was the first data scientist there. I also tried to build basically what we\\n    did at Zalando – the whole machine learning for fraud production. I love the people,\\n    but I didn\\'t feel that it was for me, so I left.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s when I joined Gitti, a direct-to-consumer brand, selling nail polishers.\\n    Within my junior period there, we went into the cosmetics segment. Also, they\\n    launched (I think several months ago) skincare. So it\\'s a beauty brand. There,\\n    I basically built the whole BI and team from scratch, and helped on the fundraising.\\n    Then on the first of September, I left Gitti to start freelancing.\\n  sec: 302\\n  time: \\'5:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How Jekaterina started freelancing\\n- line: That\\'s quite a journey. What do you do as a freelancer? Maybe before you start\\n    telling us what you do now, it\\'s also interesting to know – how did you decide\\n    what you want to do as a freelancer?\\n  sec: 433\\n  time: \\'7:13\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Okay. I never tried to... I think I just asked myself the question, “What\\n    is the next step for me?” And then what happened? I had a Bumble date. I went\\n    on this Bumble date, and we didn’t match personally, but then the guy was like,\\n    “Hey, I will invite you to a founders dinner.” I went to the founders’ dinner.\\n    There were only founders there – I think 10 people. One guy arrived super late\\n    and we didn’t not chat with him. But what I did after was just add all the people\\n    who were there on LinkedIn. And this one guy that arrived super late wrote to\\n    me “Hey, Katya. We want to hire you.” And I\\'m like, “No, I don\\'t want to be hired.\\n    I want to do freelancing. What about it?”\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then in three days, he sends me a freelancing contract, and I’m still at Gitti\\n    five days a week, and he sends me a freelance contract for one day a week. So\\n    I\\'m like, “What do I do now?” So I go to Gitti. I don\\'t know how, but I managed\\n    to convince them to give me a four days a week contract. I started freelancing\\n    for the company. Now, it\\'s also interesting because today, this company (Kittl)\\n    announced a Series A fundraiser of 11 million. That’s what I was hired for back\\n    then – to help them with the fundraising, building the data deck. So that\\'s how\\n    it started. They are a SaaS company. It\\'s a completely different business model\\n    than what I\\'m used to at Gitti, because Gitti is typical ecommerce.\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: After a month of freelancing I was like, “That looks really good. I really\\n    enjoy that.” Then some friends reached out and I was like, “Okay, let me help\\n    you.” And then I decided just to leave Gitti and see what kind of clients I could\\n    attract. I didn\\'t even know what kind of clients I should attract. I was like,\\n    “Okay, let\\'s just leave and figure this out.”\\n  sec: 449\\n  time: \\'7:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s quite optimistic. So you left. How did you actually figure out what\\n    kind of services companies need? Was it just ad hoc meetings in Bumble? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 580\\n  time: \\'9:40\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[laughs] No, then I switched to Tinder. [chuckles] I mean, it was still calculated\\n    risk because I had this one client at the end of the day – one long term client\\n    and one more kind of short-term client. So it was not like I decided, “Today I\\n    leave.” and then I left. No, it was more of a calculated risk in that I still\\n    have income (at least something) that would allow me to start.\\'\\n  sec: 593\\n  time: \\'9:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I left and then in September/October I was sitting on my couch. I was like,\\n    “I don\\'t have clients. I don\\'t have income.” I was tapping into my savings and\\n    I started panicking. Of course, I didn\\'t announce to anybody that I was freelancing.\\n    So how should anybody know about that?\\n  sec: 593\\n  time: \\'9:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s initial ways of getting freelancing clients\\n- line: So you quit but nobody knew that you were a freelancer?\\n  sec: 644\\n  time: \\'10:44\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly! I didn\\'t announce it on LinkedIn. I didn\\'t tell anybody. I mean,\\n    some people knew. I had connections. But it was not enough to pay the bills at\\n    the end of the day. That was a hard realization, because I was like, “Whoa, if\\n    I can\\'t make money, now I need to go back to work for someone.” That really hit\\n    me. So what I decided to do was announce that I\\'m freelancing right now, but not\\n    like, “Hey, I\\'m a data freelancer. I\\'m here. Pay me!” But rather to do a series\\n    of LinkedIn posts – I think there were eight LinkedIn posts directed at... [cross-talk]\\n  sec: 647\\n  time: \\'10:47\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I saw one of them and I thought, “Okay. Actually, I wanted to invite you for\\n    a long time. So let me do this.” [chuckles] Sorry for interrupting. That helps\\n    to get noticed, right?\\n  sec: 690\\n  time: \\'11:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly, especially with selfies. If you post a selfie, it\\'s crazy how many\\n    people immediately recognize you. If they associate your face with a topic, it\\'s\\n    even much easier at the end of the day. So I created those eight posts addressing\\n    direct-to-consumer brands on how to structure their KPIs, what to look at, when\\n    to look at this, how to come up with easy KPIs and not with super-complicated\\n    ones. And of course, with a selfie. [chuckles] I was posting for two weeks, I\\n    think, and I got two clients out of that.\\n  sec: 701\\n  time: \\'11:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How did you feel about posting selfies?\\n  sec: 746\\n  time: \\'12:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: It was so hard. It was so weird. Also doing selfies… I mean, I do have Instagram,\\n    but I have a closed Instagram. It\\'s a different thing. But on LinkedIn it’s a\\n    professional thing. I was like, “It\\'s so uncomfortable.” But that\\'s the thing,\\n    you need to do what you need to do and then you just do it. The funny part is,\\n    the first and second post, I was like, “Oh my god, this is so awful.” But then\\n    I didn\\'t care anymore because I just got so many likes and so many shares as well.\\n    People were also writing to me, “Hey, you\\'re doing a great job.” I was like, “Pff.\\n    Okay, then let\\'s do more selfies.” [laughs]\\n  sec: 749\\n  time: \\'12:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I still don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever post a selfie on LinkedIn. [chuckles] Because\\n    it’s so awkward, at least to me.\\n  sec: 792\\n  time: \\'13:12\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I know, it’s really awkward. But I was like, “Eh, whatever. Let\\'s just see\\n    how it works out.” And then exactly – I got two clients there.\\n  sec: 800\\n  time: \\'13:20\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: And you got clients in the segment that you wanted, right? These are direct-to-consumer\\n    brands who need help structuring their KPIs?\\n  sec: 812\\n  time: \\'13:32\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: That\\'s funny enough. One is not. One is kind of a marketplace. It\\'s kind of\\n    similar to a direct-to-consumer brand, but a marketplace. And another one was\\n    a very German company Mittelstand somewhere not far from Munich. What they wanted\\n    – and that\\'s so crazy because my profile is so broad, I can do so much stuff that\\n    it\\'s also hard for me to understand what pain point I\\'m solving exactly. So that\\n    company wanted – they had lots of data, different kinds of data and they wanted\\n    to make a project with me on how to monetize this data. I would go and figure\\n    out if we can sell this data to the government or to the job centers or to whatever.\\n    So it\\'s not working with the data, but rather trying to find revenue streams for\\n    the data that they have.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: It\\'s completely different. It\\'s not direct-to-consumer. It\\'s completely different\\n    things. And that\\'s so funny. I have three kinds of different clients. One client\\n    wants to have this full experience of having a head of analytics, who would negotiate\\n    with the vendors, who will sign the contract… well, not sign the contracts, but\\n    make sure that the contracts are written properly and owning everything end to\\n    end. It\\'s like an internal data team basically.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Another client really wants help only with the fundraising. Third client wants\\n    me to coach their data team and the business team, because sometimes it happens\\n    that they don\\'t chat with each other. Another (fourth) type of client hired me\\n    to automate some stuff that is just hard for them to do in Google Sheets. I just\\n    have those small technical projects. It’s four different kinds of ways, or packages,\\n    that I can offer – and that\\'s why it\\'s hard to communicate what exactly I’m offering.\\n  sec: 821\\n  time: \\'13:41\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: But you still managed to get clients, then I guess it works.\\n  sec: 953\\n  time: \\'15:53\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, exactly. It\\'s more for all those LinkedIn posts – when you do something\\n    like that, you really need to understand who you\\'re targeting and then adjust\\n    the messaging for them. Because if it\\'s too broad, people don\\'t feel that they\\n    are being addressed.\\n  sec: 957\\n  time: \\'15:57\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: You\\'re still targeting the same audience – the same people, right? Direct-to-consumer\\n    brands?\\n  sec: 975\\n  time: \\'16:15\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I try to, because that\\'s where most of my knowledge comes from, basically.\\n    Yeah.\\n  sec: 981\\n  time: \\'16:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How being a generalist helped Jekaterina’s career\\n- line: But from what you said about your knowledge and your background, you did pretty\\n    much everything when it comes to data. Maybe you didn’t do MLOps, or at least\\n    you didn\\'t tell us about that, but every single data role that is out there, you\\n    did this. You did data analysis, and as a data analyst, you needed to do data\\n    engineering. Then you did data science at Zalando.\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Then you worked at Gitti as a head of BI, or somebody that set up the BI team.\\n    I don’t know, you didn\\'t work maybe as an ML engineer, but apart from that… or\\n    maybe you actually did do some stuff there, too. So it\\'s like everything. Also,\\n    in addition to that, you tried a startup. That\\'s a lot. Maybe the question I have\\n    is – it seems like you enjoy doing different things.\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: But does it help you in your career to know so many things and to be interested\\n    in so many areas?\\n  sec: 990\\n  time: \\'16:30\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. That\\'s this whole generalist part, right? I never wanted to be a specialist\\n    in anything. I never wanted to optimize, to figure out how many layers I want\\n    to have in my deep learning model. I\\'m not excited about that. You immediately\\n    see on my face, I\\'m like “Ugh”. But what I really get excited about is connecting\\n    the dots between all those specialized people in the business. Because I did data\\n    engineering, I did a bit of MLOps as well by the way, I did a bit of marketing\\n    analytics, I did BI, I did tracking (I hate tracking [chuckles]) – this whole\\n    Google Analytics thing, but I also did that. Then I can challenge all of those\\n    parts and know the best practices there. Can I do it myself? Some of the stuff,\\n    yes and some of the stuff, no.\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then it also starts to be – I\\'m not a profile for corporate companies, for\\n    instance. For Zalando right now, what I enjoy doing and what I collected over\\n    the time – I\\'m not the best fit. For Delivery Hero either, I\\'m not the best fit.\\n    Because they are searching for very specialized people and I don\\'t want to do\\n    that. My profile, this whole generalistic approach, works better for startups,\\n    where I can chat with the business, and I can easily explain the numbers to them\\n    and then they can go to the marketing team and figure out their marketing analytics\\n    or go to the tech team and speak their language.\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s so funny, because bioinformatics, it\\'s a bridge between informaticians\\n    and biologists because those two don\\'t know how to communicate with each other.\\n    Throughout my entire career, I was always just this person who links someone but\\n    doesn\\'t know anything in depth. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1055\\n  time: \\'17:35\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you think it somehow makes your chances of having a successful career smaller?\\n    Or do you think it\\'s fine?\\n  sec: 1176\\n  time: \\'19:36\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: If you\\'re a generalist sitting in Zalando, and you need to optimize for deep\\n    learning models, you will be internally unhappy by default. And if you\\'re internally\\n    unhappy in your job, you will not succeed in this job. In order to succeed, you\\n    need to be happy. [laughs] [Alexey agrees] I think it boils down to this – the\\n    more excited you are, the more you overdeliver. Maybe let me brag. It was so crazy\\n    right now.\\n  sec: 1189\\n  time: \\'19:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: For one of my clients, they were using Fivetran. Fivetran is a data extraction\\n    tool. Basically, it gets the data, let\\'s say, from Shopify and packs the raw data\\n    into the data warehouse. What I figured out is that they had a bug in their codebase\\n    for how they calculate spends on Google ads. What I did is just push the fix to\\n    their codebase and it got merged. This thing just made me so happy. The client\\n    was like, “What?! You just improved our vendor codebase!” I\\'m like, “Yes.” I\\'m\\n    just super happy about this. Once you\\'re happy, you\\'re going this extra mile,\\n    and you\\'re enjoying it. You are enjoying working until super late.\\n  sec: 1189\\n  time: \\'19:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Connecting business and data\\n- line: But it still looks like you somewhat have focus right now. Right now, at least\\n    your posts focus on KPIs. I guess, this is related to what you said you enjoyed\\n    doing most, which is connecting the dots between different people and engineers.\\n    That\\'s correct, right? Right now, this is your focus?\\n  sec: 1282\\n  time: \\'21:22\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, right now I\\'m focusing on connecting the dots between business and data.\\n    Basically, helping business people understand how to steer their business and\\n    according to what numbers – easy numbers or even more complicated numbers, and\\n    how to transfer those KPIs or this logic for KPIs into the infrastructure. What\\n    do I need there? Do I need help from the tech team? I cannot do it myself. How\\n    can I do it? And do I do this whole implementation or outsource this implementation?\\n    But I know exactly what the steps there are.\\n  sec: 1309\\n  time: \\'21:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So the focus right now is on working together with the founders or business\\n    people and to translate this everything into the data parts. Again, for instance,\\n    data science, for me, is out of the question right now, because I\\'m working with\\n    the founders, who just really need to know, “What was our revenue yesterday? What\\n    did we pay for the customers yesterday? What was the percentage of returning customers?”\\n    That’s easier stuff, but that\\'s what they need to know in order to understand\\n    how to steer the business and how the business is going. Even at Gitti, we never\\n    started with data science, although I wanted to, but just the business was not\\n    there.\\n  sec: 1309\\n  time: \\'21:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: How Jekaterina’s LinkedIn posts helped her get clients\\n- line: I see that we have a few questions and some of them are related to the discussion.\\n    A question from Adonis is related to your posts. The question is, “Looking back,\\n    what was the most important thing about the posts that helped you get the clients?”\\n  sec: 1389\\n  time: \\'23:09\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'What was the most important thing in the LinkedIn posts? Really, it was three\\n    things: figuring out who I am addressing so that I would structure the posts in\\n    a way that the people who read it will understand immediately that I\\'\\'m addressing\\n    them. You don\\'\\'t start with “What will my post be?” You start with “What is my\\n    audience? What\\'\\'s the type of voice I\\'\\'m using?” Am I professional, flirty, and\\n    humorous or am I super professional? What is the style? This is one thing.\\'\\n  sec: 1406\\n  time: \\'23:26\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Then the second thing is, I shared those posts with two of my friends, and\\n    they had brutal feedback on that. I took it, I improved it – done. So getting\\n    feedback was the second thing. And the third one, I think it was one of the hardest\\n    – to put myself out there with those selfies. That\\'s where internally I had to\\n    struggle with myself. That\\'s where you also realize that might be the point when\\n    you\\'re getting out of your comfort zone, which also might be good. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1406\\n  time: \\'23:26\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: We already discussed who you are addressing – direct-to-consumer brands who\\n    are interested in improving or defining their KPIs. What about the type of voice\\n    and style? Is it flirty, as you said, or is it professional? How do you decide?\\n    Do you test this? Or do you just assume that this one will work better? Maybe\\n    walk us through one of the posts and how you did it.\\n  sec: 1488\\n  time: \\'24:48\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: What I realized is that I love chatting with people. I\\'m loud. I love laughing.\\n    I love stupid jokes. I love clever jokes. But I can also be serious, professional\\n    and clever and figure out stuff and help people. That\\'s what I thought – I wanted\\n    to bring my personality over through those posts. Basically, professional, clever,\\n    but filled with a bit of my weird humor. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1515\\n  time: \\'25:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I also wanted to kind of reflect this whole journey a bit. I realized that\\n    I don\\'t want to fake anything. At the end of the day, clients are not only paying\\n    for the infrastructure, they are paying for the whole package. The whole package\\n    is this energetic person who comes into the room and is always saying hi to everyone\\n    and even entertains the team sometimes. This energy is what people pay for as\\n    well, at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 1515\\n  time: \\'25:15\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you have any go-to stupid jokes that you use to energize the team? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1584\\n  time: \\'26:24\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Oh, no. It\\'s super ad hoc-ey, right? It\\'s not even stupid joking. It\\'s rather\\n    those internal jokes that you get with the teams, while you sit with them. You\\n    just start to be friends with those people, right? It\\'s so funny, with all my\\n    clients, with the older teams, I\\'m in a really good relationship, and they are\\n    super happy to see me and I\\'m also super happy to see them. So you start to have\\n    those internal jokes at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 1589\\n  time: \\'26:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I\\'m trying to make a connection between the posts that target a specific audience\\n    and the four different types of work that you do. To me, they don\\'t seem super\\n    related. The posts are KPI-related but, as you said, your work falls into four\\n    different buckets – full experience as a head of analytics, fundraising, coaching\\n    data and business teams, and then automating stuff. These are the kinds of different\\n    packages. So how did the posts help you get things that don\\'t seem very related?\\n  sec: 1623\\n  time: \\'27:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, it’s because of the reach. They figured out, “Hey, this person knows\\n    something. What she writes makes sense. Let’s just chat with her.” People kind\\n    of relate it. Of course, fundraising is another thing. But people relate that,\\n    “Okay, she\\'s technical enough that she can automate some stuff and she understands\\n    me immediately.” That\\'s what I meant. It\\'s hard for me and that\\'s what I need\\n    to figure out – how to transmit the message of what I really do.\\n  sec: 1665\\n  time: \\'27:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: At the end of the day, what do I really want to do? Fundraising is super tiresome.\\n    I had calls at 11 PM and had to work till 3 AM because in the morning we had to\\n    submit everything to the investor. It\\'s not this dream job. It\\'s super intense.\\n    The day after, I was just lying in my bed sleeping. So do I want to do this job\\n    for the next three years? Or what is it exactly that I\\'m enjoying the most where\\n    I don\\'t burn myself out either? First, I need to actually figure out this part\\n    and then I need to figure out how to transmit it through a LinkedIn post so that\\n    I attract the right audience as well.\\n  sec: 1665\\n  time: \\'27:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s work in fundraising\\n- line: But for you as a generalist, what you enjoy now might not be the same as what\\n    you enjoy tomorrow, right? How do you live with this? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 1750\\n  time: \\'29:10\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah. Yes, exactly. That\\'s a good question. Right now, I know that fundraising\\n    is fun and that\\'s where you get lots of understanding about things like what investors\\n    want, how they steer the business, or want to steer the business, but it\\'s super\\n    intense. Let\\'s put it differently. At the end of the day, what matters are also\\n    people – who you work with.\\n  sec: 1761\\n  time: \\'29:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: All my clients are super fun, nice people. Sometimes, of course, there are\\n    some parts that I don\\'t enjoy doing like data warehouse optimization. I\\'m like,\\n    “Whaaaat?” But that still helps – the people help, this whole atmosphere helps.\\n    That\\'s where I’m still not sure which direction to go in, regarding what I love.\\n    Plus, is there a market for that as well? Fundraising doesn\\'t happen every day.\\n  sec: 1761\\n  time: \\'29:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What kind of work exactly do you do for fundraising? I guess it\\'s somehow\\n    still related to KPIs? You need to show the company in a good light, “Okay, these\\n    are the KPIs and this is how the KPIs look so far and this is how they will look\\n    in the future.” So you\\'re still kind of connecting business and data for fundraising.\\n    Right?\\n  sec: 1826\\n  time: \\'30:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly, exactly. Basically, there are just questions of cohorts, “How active\\n    are our cohorts?” And I sit together with the founder and we define what a cohort\\n    actually is, what retention actually is, and how we calculate this. Then, there\\n    are 10 different ways of how we can calculate it and you decide, “Okay, which\\n    one so I submit and how do I visualize it?” And if there is some kind of weird\\n    stuff happening, “How do I explain this so that investors don\\'t find it weird.”\\n    Basically, we sit together with the business and try to figure out how to show,\\n    what to show, and then I just go collect the data through different databases,\\n    different systems, wrangle something in Python, create the charts in Google Sheets.\\n    I started loving Google Sheets. [chuckles] And then it’s iterate, iterate, iterate.\\n    And then maybe investors sometimes have other questions.\\n  sec: 1845\\n  time: \\'30:45\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Cohorts and KPIs\\n- line: Do you have any examples of these cohorts and KPIs? Maybe it doesn\\'t have\\n    to come from a specific client, but just to understand what exactly you do.\\n  sec: 1906\\n  time: \\'31:46\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. For instance, for SaaS, the business to consumer segment (not B2B, but\\n    B2C). There, you sign up. Let’s take Facebook for example – you sign up and then\\n    you can post, you can like, you can just be active on the platform. Now the question\\n    is – those who signed up in April, how active are they? That\\'s where you define\\n    activity. What is activity? Is it liking? Is it scrolling? Is it whatever? Those\\n    who signed up in April, how active are they compared to those who signed up in\\n    September, for instance? And if you see that September cohort is really bad, you\\'re\\n    like, “Okay, what happened? Did our product start to be really bad? Yes, no? Is\\n    it the traffic that marketing\\'s attracting? Is it bad or good? Yes, no?” Then\\n    you start to dig deeper like, “What is it about those people that they are just\\n    not active on the platform from specific cohorts?”\\n  sec: 1915\\n  time: \\'31:55\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Okay, first it\\'s about defining KPIs, then defining cohorts, doing some analysis,\\n    showing charts, and then if something is off, going there and understanding what\\'s\\n    happening. You do this for fundraising, too? Does it help to attract more money?\\n  sec: 1991\\n  time: \\'33:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. That\\'s so funny, half of the stuff that is normally done for fundraising\\n    can also be reused in the business – to look at this on a monthly level. Some\\n    of the stuff we never implemented – it\\'s only for fundraising. But yeah, it\\'s\\n    kind of how business wants to steer and then we just figure out how to see how\\n    the business performs. What are the users doing? Why are they doing it?\\n  sec: 2012\\n  time: \\'33:32\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Improving communication between the data and business teams\\n- line: We spoke about fundraising to some extent, but I\\'m also curious about the\\n    other three parts, especially this coaching data and the business team aspect.\\n    How is it similar? How is it related? What do you do there?\\n  sec: 2043\\n  time: \\'34:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: This project will be… I\\'m not doing it right now, it\\'s one of the future projects.\\n    The problem there is that the company is pretty... It\\'s like six, seven years\\n    old. They do have the data team, they do have the business team. However, it\\'s\\n    hard for businesses to be data-driven because nobody coached them to be data-driven.\\n    What is data driven nowadays? Everybody uses this word, but nobody can explain\\n    what it actually means at the end of the day or how to actually start being this.\\n    So the business team is super frustrated. They need to be data-driven, but they\\n    have no clue how and what this means. Then the data team is there, and they need\\n    to manage all these ad hoc requests. The infrastructure might already be outdated.\\n    And then they don\\'t understand just what the business team needs because they\\n    don\\'t have time to understand the business.\\n  sec: 2056\\n  time: \\'34:16\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Those people are not business savvy. That\\'s the thing, you have engineers\\n    or data people who are not business savvy and you have business people who are\\n    not data savvy, so it will not work by default. And that\\'s where I try to help.\\n    Well, I try to help the business people to be more data-driven, or data savvy,\\n    and the data people to be more business savvy. Then once all those two parties\\n    go towards each other a bit, like one step, then it\\'s already a success at the\\n    end of the day. It\\'s also hard for me to measure the success because what I do\\n    is just coach them on how to communicate with each other. [chuckles] How do you\\n    measure communication – the success of my work? It takes time, right? It takes\\n    even several months, actually, when business will know the impact of this coaching.\\n  sec: 2056\\n  time: \\'34:16\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So you kind of act as a translator – you translate from one language to another.\\n    But then, I guess, the ultimate goal is to let people be able to talk between\\n    each other without you, right? [Jekaterina agrees] You do this, then you leave,\\n    and you help somebody else achieve the same.\\n  sec: 2170\\n  time: \\'36:10\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. That\\'s exactly what I was doing with bioinformatics as well – helping\\n    those informaticians and  biologists actually to make sure that this whole thing\\n    works together.\\n  sec: 2189\\n  time: \\'36:29\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Motivating every link in the company’s chain\\n- line: I think you mentioned that. The question I have right now is “How does being\\n    a generalist help you now?” And I think one thing you mentioned is – you\\'ve done\\n    a lot of stuff already, so sometimes you can just go ahead and do this. Even if\\n    you don\\'t do this yourself, you kind of have an idea in your mind of how you would\\n    approach this. So that\\'s one thing, I think, that can help you in your current\\n    role. Are there other things that you think are also helpful for you right now?\\n  sec: 2203\\n  time: \\'36:43\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. I also mentioned that I know best practices. That\\'s so funny, people\\n    know that I know best practices. but I don\\'t know… I know what doesn\\'t work for\\n    sure. Those mistakes are normally done by young teams over and over. You see the\\n    patterns, and you\\'re like, “Hey, I already know now that in three months we\\'ll\\n    struggle with that. So let\\'s not do that.” So that’s knowing what doesn\\'t work\\n    because I was in those different roles, it helps me now to prevent, let\\'s call\\n    them “disasters,” in the future.\\n  sec: 2234\\n  time: \\'37:14\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Also, it\\'s all about the people\\'s communication. You just adjust to how people\\n    communicate, and then you try to communicate in their language. That\\'s why, with\\n    the generalist part – I chatted with so many different people. I had to chat with\\n    the data engineers, PMS, CEOs, CTOs, CPOs. And you need to find a way of how to\\n    make them what you want them to make. [chuckles] That entails different approaches\\n    to different people. You need to know how to motivate every segment of it – every\\n    person, basically.\\n  sec: 2234\\n  time: \\'37:14\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: The cons of freelancing\\n- line: Are there any cons of freelancing? Are there any cons of being a generalist\\n    when freelancing right now?\\n  sec: 2325\\n  time: \\'38:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, it’s hard to sell myself, because people just ask, “Hey, Katya – what\\n    is the difference between you and a data agency?” This is also a hard explanation\\n    for me to actually define the real difference there, because again, people also\\n    pay for this energy. How do I tell them, “Hey, you will pay for the nice mood\\n    that you will have in the office?” [chuckles] It doesn\\'t work that way.\\n  sec: 2336\\n  time: \\'38:56\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That’s too bad. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2366\\n  time: \\'39:26\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. [chuckle] So I think it\\'s hard for me to sell this generalistic thing\\n    because there are lots of other agencies or freelancers who have a very specialized\\n    focus and then people ask me, “What is the difference between you and them?\\n  sec: 2367\\n  time: \\'39:27\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What is a data agency?\\n  sec: 2390\\n  time: \\'39:50\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: There are several data agencies in Berlin that help direct-to-consumer brands\\n    build data warehouses, reporting tools on top of it, and dashboards. They may\\n    also might help a bit with the tracking. I\\'m kind of competing with them, but\\n    on the other hand, I\\'m not. Because I\\'m not going against the typical data engineer\\n    – I\\'m more this holistic who will really fit with the business-first, figure things\\n    out and then implement.\\n  sec: 2393\\n  time: \\'39:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: From what you described in terms of what data agencies do, it looks like they\\n    already have some packages. If I know that I need a data warehouse, I go to them,\\n    and I tell them, “Hey, come over and build me a data warehouse.” But what if I\\n    don\\'t know that I need a data warehouse? Who do I go to?\\n  sec: 2429\\n  time: \\'40:29\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, that\\'s the thing. Everything is about how you sell yourself. Data agencies\\n    don\\'t sell themselves by saying, “We’ll build your data warehouse.” They sell\\n    dashboards. And that\\'s what the CEO and CPO and the business founders need, right?\\n    What is in the back? They\\'re like, “I don\\'t care. I just want this fancy dashboard\\n    that shows me my sales for the last several days.” Of course, the agencies figured\\n    out that this is a selling point – their selling audience is actually C-level\\n    (CMO, CEO, CPOs). If there’s a CTO, that already means that they might be a tech\\n    team who can kind of handle that. Those people are the selling points. So how\\n    do I adjust my messaging to those people? That\\'s the thing, again, adjusting the\\n    messaging so that the customers feel addressed at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 2447\\n  time: \\'40:47\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So how do you compete with them? By making selfies? [Jekaterina laughs] Posting\\n    selfies on LinkedIn? Because I don\\'t think they do this, right? [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2504\\n  time: \\'41:44\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: No. [laughs] Exactly. What I feel is that I\\'m more on the business side. I\\n    try to be more on the business side and because I was operationally involved at\\n    Gitti at steering business with data, and also in the fundraising events, which\\n    is experience that those agencies don\\'t have – operationally being involved in\\n    businesses, helping the marketing team. They just come, build, they leave (normally).\\n    Of course, sometimes they maintain the infrastructure and maintain the dashboards,\\n    but they are not actively involved in the business team. And that\\'s where I get\\n    involved immediately.\\n  sec: 2512\\n  time: \\'41:52\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Balancing projects and networking\\n- line: Okay. We have a few more questions. A question from Claire, “What are the\\n    pros and cons of freelancing, according to your experience?”\\n  sec: 2560\\n  time: \\'42:40\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yeah, we discussed this with Alex before – don\\'t be confused by this “free”\\n    prefix in “freelancing”. You\\'re free in terms of choosing who you work with and\\n    when you work, but that doesn\\'t mean that you will now surf for a week and then\\n    can maybe do three hours of work. This doesn\\'t work, because you need to work\\n    on the project that you have right now, but you also need to grow your own freelancing\\n    business. This basically entails reaching out to new customers, or helping them\\n    somehow, so that you get the audience of people who know you. You need to make\\n    this audience bigger. Those are two things that you need to do in parallel.\\n  sec: 2571\\n  time: \\'42:51\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That\\'s why there\\'s not so much “free” time in freelancing at the end of the\\n    day. The process that I use, for instance, I like to work with ambitious people\\n    – startups. Those are very motivated people, fast people, fast thinkers – they\\n    want to solve the problem. I\\'m really intrigued by those kinds of people. The\\n    disadvantage of freelancing is that sometimes – one month you will be without\\n    money. How do you deal with this? That means that if I earn like 10K today, that\\n    doesn\\'t mean that I need to spend those 10K today. That means that I need to distribute\\n    those 10K and do this whole financial planning of my life, so that I can buy food.\\n    This is exactly what hit me in September/October. I was just without clients,\\n    so without the proper income. And this is a bit scary.\\n  sec: 2571\\n  time: \\'42:51\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How do you deal with this stress? By planning things?\\n  sec: 2685\\n  time: \\'44:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I mean, yes, planning. Also, knowing exactly how much you spend and not overspend.\\n    You must see that you’re not only working on your project, but you’re also growing\\n    this audience that will become the leads afterward. Basically, projects are short-term\\n    optimization, but this growth of the audience is long-term optimization, where\\n    you don\\'t know what will come out of this at the end. That’s the instability or\\n    the risk that you just take. Of course, you should not go freelancing if you don\\'t\\n    have any savings. That\\'s hard. Mentally, this will be very hard.\\n  sec: 2689\\n  time: \\'44:49\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Or at least if you have a client lined up for the next half a year. Right?\\n  sec: 2738\\n  time: \\'45:38\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Exactly. Then it\\'s fine. The hardest part… if you don\\'t have clients,\\n    you will figure it out. Maybe you can go to the coffee shop and work there. You\\n    will figure it out. But mental health and this mental instability – that hits\\n    hard.\\n  sec: 2743\\n  time: \\'45:43\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: What do you do for that? How do you deal with this?\\n  sec: 2765\\n  time: \\'46:05\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: In September/October, when I was sitting without clients, I was like, “Whoa.”\\n    I was immediately thinking, “Okay, can I sell something on those platforms where\\n    freelancers do some kind of small stuff for you? Do I need to sign up for the\\n    freelancers networks? What should I do?”\\n  sec: 2769\\n  time: \\'46:09\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Like Fiverr, right? These kinds of places?\\n  sec: 2787\\n  time: \\'46:27\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes, exactly. Then I was like “This is not what I want to do at the end of\\n    the day.” And then I came up with those posts. So you need to be creative, and\\n    you will be creative once you realize… [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2788\\n  time: \\'46:28\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: That if you don\\'t, then you won’t have anything to eat, right?\\n  sec: 2805\\n  time: \\'46:45\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. But that\\'s the funny part. There should be calculated risks. I didn\\'t\\n    go freelancing all of a sudden. I had a customer already, where I was like, “Okay,\\n    we discussed things. It’s been going well for several months. I feel good. They\\n    feel good about me.” So that\\'s when I felt like, “Okay, I can leave my stable\\n    job.” And then, I learned about this myself, that I can stretch myself – I started\\n    to learn about my boundaries, about my limitations, and also about myself more,\\n    once I got out of my comfort zone. That\\'s the thing. Oh! One more thing that\\'s\\n    crazy with freelancing – every new client will challenge you. I feel like I’m\\n    constantly in the job application process and in a constant salary negotiation\\n    process. You come in and what I\\'m used to at Gitti, but had been working there\\n    for two years – I had lots of freedom, but only because I earned this freedom.\\n    With every new client, I don\\'t have this freedom. I don\\'t have this trust. So\\n    I need to build this trust, and building this trust with every client is hard.\\n    It takes time. That\\'s where I was like “Woah, constant salary negotiations, constant\\n    job application, constant building trust… this is hard.”\\n  sec: 2808\\n  time: \\'46:48\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Yeah, it does sound very hard. Do you work more now than compared to previously?\\n  sec: 2895\\n  time: \\'48:15\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. Yes, I do work more. That\\'s the thing, chatting with people – do you\\n    consider that work or not work? Growing this audience.\\n  sec: 2903\\n  time: \\'48:23\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Networking. Yeah. Okay.\\n  sec: 2915\\n  time: \\'48:35\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- header: The importance of enjoying what you do\\n- line: That\\'s the question – you, as a person, are you happy doing that? If you\\'re\\n    happy doing that, if you enjoy having three coffee meetings during the day in\\n    different parts of the city and you\\'re running around like crazy – and you need\\n    to come to those meetings as if you\\'re fresh, energized. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 2916\\n  time: \\'48:36\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: And you still need to do work for other clients. Right?\\n  sec: 2938\\n  time: \\'48:58\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Exactly. Again, if it makes you happy, if you have the energy for that – and\\n    you need to create this energy, energy doesn\\'t come from out of the blue – then\\n    yes, you will enjoy that. And it doesn\\'t matter how long you will work at the\\n    end of the day. But it\\'s also the question of “Is it working hours or not?” That\\'s\\n    the thing, chatting with people – I don\\'t see that as working hours. But for those\\n    hours, currently, I\\'m not paid either.\\n  sec: 2941\\n  time: \\'49:01\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: How do you create this energy? Where do you get it from?\\n  sec: 2971\\n  time: \\'49:31\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I don\\'t know. [laughs]\\n  sec: 2974\\n  time: \\'49:34\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Do you just naturally come refreshed to every meeting?\\n  sec: 2981\\n  time: \\'49:41\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: No, the thing is that I think before joining Gitti, I was calmer and maybe\\n    scattered and maybe also more irritated by some stuff. That\\'s what I love about\\n    Gitti, as I also said to the founder – I was able to see within Gitti, that I\\n    managed to do lots of things and that I was able to get out of my comfort zone\\n    and achieve lots of stuff. I always felt like, “There is a problem. Yes, it\\'s\\n    a problem but I will figure out how to do this.” This belief that you will figure\\n    it out somehow turned back to me as, “I don\\'t need to be sad. I don\\'t need to\\n    be depressed about this. I will figure this out.” This was a mind change for me.\\n    That\\'s where I am now. I\\'m super happy with what I\\'m doing again. This happiness\\n    creates the energy at the end of the day.\\n  sec: 2984\\n  time: \\'49:44\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: In some ways, the secret is positive self-talk. Right?\\n  sec: 3057\\n  time: \\'50:57\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[chuckles] Exactly. But that\\'\\'s the thing, if you start doubting yourself,\\n    that\\'\\'s the most negative energy that you can have. It will not help further.\\'\\n  sec: 3062\\n  time: \\'51:02\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Growing the client base\\n- line: Sarah wrote a comment “Passion and desire to help and the impact in many trials\\n    is so fulfilling.” [Jekaterina agrees] This is a good summary. So you said that\\n    in addition to “work,” meaning helping clients, you also need to grow your client\\n    base, you need to grow your network, you need to have leads for the next gigs.\\n    After you finish the current job, you need to have another one. The question from\\n    Wilhelm is, “How do you reach out for new clients? How do you grow your client\\n    base?”\\n  sec: 3076\\n  time: \\'51:16\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I don\\'t do cold outreach. This is hard. This is annoying. This makes me sad\\n    – when somebody doesn\\'t answer my message. [chuckles] So I decided not to go with\\n    that. Before I started posting on LinkedIn, what I did – I was invited to a Slack\\n    channel of direct-to-consumer brands, where founders and operators talk about\\n    where to get the best price for packaging, for instance. There were like 200 people,\\n    and I stalked all of them on LinkedIn. I was blocked by LinkedIn twice for several\\n    days because of this. Because I was just doing it really quickly. What I needed\\n    was for them to see that I checked them out. I didn\\'t care about their profiles.\\n    Then two people reached out to me as well from there. Basically, this stalking\\n    helped a bit. [chuckles]\\n  sec: 3113\\n  time: \\'51:53\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: It\\'s like cold outreach, but a little bit different, right? You stalk them,\\n    you make sure that they have this view – in LinkedIn, there is a setting that\\n    lets people see that you visited their profile. This is enabled for you, so you\\n    visit their profile, they see it, and then they check your profile, right? And\\n    then they decide to talk to you themselves?\\n  sec: 3177\\n  time: \\'52:57\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Yes. I mean, the conversion rate from 250 people to 2 people is super small,\\n    I agree. But it\\'s fine. It worked out. And it took me maybe one hour for two possible\\n    leads. Fine. So there’s that. Also, if somebody posts on LinkedIn, “Hey, I have\\n    this reporting. What is the best reporting tool?” Then I jump immediately on that\\n    question. I\\'m also in several private Slack channels where people ask questions\\n    and I also jumped on that. I\\'m like, “Okay, let me help you.”\\n  sec: 3201\\n  time: \\'53:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: There’s one potential client – well, not even potential, but we just chatted\\n    with her – her freelancer for Google Analytics is not answering her and she has\\n    a project where she wants to move from GA3 to GA4 and adjust some stuff. So I\\n    was like, “Hey, let\\'s have a chat. I want to understand your problem. I might\\n    not be able to do that, but I know people who might be able to do that.” We just\\n    chatted for 20 minutes and she was super thankful that I just reached out and\\n    helped her. It might not be that she converts to a customer, but she has seen\\n    my face, she has seen what I can do, so she can also maybe suggest me to someone.\\n  sec: 3201\\n  time: \\'53:21\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: Okay, so networking – helping and stalking people on LinkedIn. [chuckles]\\n    That\\'s your secret?\\n  sec: 3289\\n  time: \\'54:49\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'[laughs] And selfies. Don’t forget selfies.\\'\\n  sec: 3295\\n  time: \\'54:55\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: In the office work vs working remotely\\n- line: Selfies, yeah. That\\'s the most important thing. Do you work remotely or is\\n    it always within Berlin in an office?\\n  sec: 3299\\n  time: \\'54:59\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: I love being in the office. That\\'s where this whole energy is great – this\\n    whole communication with the team. I am not the typical digital nomad who will\\n    go to Bali, surf, and then work. I\\'m trying to always do 100%. So either 100%\\n    work or 100% vacation. I don’t do this whole workcation thing. No. I am still\\n    considering if I should stay in Germany and Berlin or if I should move somewhere\\n    else. I still don\\'t know.\\n  sec: 3308\\n  time: \\'55:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: But I feel now that there is a freedom for me. That\\'s where the “free” comes\\n    in. If I\\'m able to structure my clients in a way that I can work remotely for\\n    them, and I don\\'t need to be in the office, then I can move to wherever I want.\\n    This is also amazing. That\\'s where, all sudden, the advantage of this “free” in\\n    “freelance” comes in.\\n  sec: 3308\\n  time: \\'55:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s advice who people who feel stuck\\n- line: Interesting. I noticed that there is one question in the list of questions\\n    that we prepared. I don\\'t know if we have enough time – we only have three minutes\\n    – but maybe we can try to cover it quickly. What would be your advice for people\\n    who feel stuck at what they\\'re doing?\\n  sec: 3371\\n  time: \\'56:11\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Don\\'t sit, act. Act immediately. Again, don\\'t quit today. [chuckles] Don\\'t\\n    do that. Let\\'s say you\\'re a machine learning engineer, and you\\'re like, “I\\'m a\\n    bit stuck at work. What should I do?” Reach out to consultancies and talk to them.\\n    Maybe you could join them as a freelancer one day a week. Just start chatting\\n    with people and try to figure out what others can offer. Or do what I did as well.\\n    I reached out to data consultants – people who have a similar background to me,\\n    but much more experienced. He is targeting other customer groups. I just told\\n    him “Hey, I want to do this. What would be your advice?” Just start chatting with\\n    people and try to figure things out. Take calculated risks, but don\\'t sit on the\\n    call on the couch. Really just start doing something. Even small things are also\\n    fine.\\n  sec: 3390\\n  time: \\'56:30\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: If you feel stuck and you want to be a freelancer, this is what you should\\n    do? In general – talk to people, right?\\n  sec: 3454\\n  time: \\'57:34\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: But that\\'s the thing, even if you don\\'t want to do freelancing. Just start\\n    chatting with people who you think are exciting, who you think can help you with\\n    advice or something else. People love to help. People will write back.\\n  sec: 3462\\n  time: \\'57:42\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- header: Jekaterina’s resource recommendations\\n- line: Is there any book or other resource that you can recommend to the listeners?\\n  sec: 3483\\n  time: \\'58:03\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: \\'Yes. I think there are two. One is more general, as in “generalist”. It’s\\n    called The Power of Moments: Why Certain Experiences Have Extraordinary Impact.\\n    Basically, they talk a lot about lots of things, like how to do storytelling with\\n    very nice examples from all over the world. They explain how to create moments\\n    for other people that they will remember and how to create this energy, and what\\n    it actually means to create this energy. I love this book. I just read it recently.\\'\\n  sec: 3488\\n  time: \\'58:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: So that\\'s the general book and another one is more about marketing analytics,\\n    which is what I was doing the last few years. There\\'s this guy in Google, who’s\\n    like the Senior Director of Strategic Analytics or something – Avinash Kaushik.\\n    So his blog and newsletters. That\\'s just a bomb of knowledge. So for anyone who\\n    is interested in marketing analytics, that\\'s the newsletter to read.\\n  sec: 3488\\n  time: \\'58:08\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n- line: I also usually ask what the best way to reach out to you is, but I think it\\'s\\n    LinkedIn. Right? [Jekaterina confirms] We’ll include the link to your profile.\\n    I think that\\'s all we have time for today. That was amazing – talking to you.\\n    You\\'re very energetic. I feel the energy now. I can go and work and something.\\n    Great! Yeah, thanks for joining us today. Thanks for sharing all that. Thanks\\n    for telling your story. It was amazing. Thanks, everyone else, for joining us\\n    today. Have a great rest of your day!\\n  sec: 3564\\n  time: \\'59:24\\'\\n  who: Alexey\\n- line: Thank you so much. Thank you for having me and have a nice day as well.\\n  sec: 3596\\n  time: \\'59:56\\'\\n  who: Jekaterina\\n---\\n\\nLinks:\\n\\n* [Jekaterina\\'s LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jekaterina-kokatjuhha/){:target=\"_blank\"}')"

I… What can I tell you? The thing is, if you want to apply for aid and you want to have a chance to be selected, please make sure that you focus on something they care about. For example, try to figure out what they're researching, especially, for example, a searching field – if you're doing it for healthcare. Figure out what they're interested in.

And the second thing is all of the works I have already done way before applying to it. I have done a lot of volunteer work; I have touched a lot – I've been [involved with] all kinds of different AI and applied it to different domains. So I think that's one of the reasons why I got it. So what is it all about? Usually, in the fellowship – you can think of it like a scholarship because it kind of is like a scholarship. They give you money, right? For example $10,000 per year. By the way, they increased that – now it's $12,000. But usually it’s $10,000 a year for three years, depending on the region.\",\n",

Because this was around medical communication, they did provide doctors. So we had a meeting with a doctor and we understood their needs. He told us, “We already have AI tools, but we would like it if the AI notified when it was finished its task.” For example, if it was going over a chest X ray, going over a radio and a modality and then notified them about it.

Because almost everyone was touched by it, right? So they were overwhelmed in the radiology section. A radiologist normally has only eight minutes to read the scan and then do the report. So what they wanted us to do was to expedite this part – to actually have the AI come up with the report, and then the radiologist can actually go over the report and fix it, if possible. So that was kind of the final solution that it was about. That’s it – we figure out what the mentors want from us, we review our idea with them, and then keep refining it. Obviously, when you have a couple of engineers put together, most of the time, the solution only comes near the end of the hackathon. [chuckles] You know how we love to work at the last minute.

Let's say you like the challenge. One of the first things we do is read about the challenge. Just know what it is, what you're going to do and how comfortable you're going to be with it.

Actually, one of the things we don't have in Morocco, sadly, for now \\u2013 we don't have funding for research.

Way before that, I was involved in a lot of Google stuff, like with the GDG (Google Developers Groups). I knew they had a program called Google PhD Fellowship. I applied to it. I\\u2026 What can I tell you? The thing is, if you want to apply for aid and you want to have a chance to be selected, please make sure that you focus on something they care about. For example, try to figure out what they're researching, especially, for example, a searching field \\u2013 if you're doing it for healthcare. Figure out what they're interested in.

I think that's why I got it, but I believe strongly that most of the reasons why I really got it was not just around the proposal, but also, obviously, my supervisor. And the second thing is all of the works I have already done way before applying to it. I have done a lot of volunteer work; I have touched a lot \\u2013 I've been [involved with] all kinds of different AI and applied it to different domains. So I think that's one of the reasons why I got it. So what is it all about? Usually, in the fellowship \\u2013 you can think of it like a scholarship because it kind of is like a scholarship. They give you money, right? For example $10,000 per year. By the way, they increased that \\u2013 now it's $12,000.

[chuckles] So I did almost everything by myself. Sometimes, when we had our meetings, I was like, \\u201cWhat do you think of my proposal?\\u201d \\u201cIs it relevant or not?\\u201d And then he would be like, \\u201cYeah, it's interesting. You can go ahead with it.\\u201d That's practically much of our meeting. [chuckles] That's what I do in our meeting. Well, apart from that, there is the PhD Fellowship Summit that I invite you to \\u2013 it's a virtual Summit, where obviously, there are all of the Google PhD fellows gathered together.

We didn't have the data at the time. We kind of had to get creative regarding where we got it from.

Apart from that, from then on, I started volunteering with Omdena more. I actually volunteered with their second project about trash out, which was about detecting if a certain trash is recyclable or not, using computer vision. For example, you have some kind of trash, and then you figure out if it's recyclable or not. Because every region in the world has its own regulations, on top of figuring out if it was recyclable or not, we had to figure it out\\u2026 It depends on what type of actual trash it is, depending on the region.

Yes. They were trying to figure out if\\u2026 For example, when someone had surgery to replace one of these cervicals, was the movement still the same as it is in normal settings? Because, what happened was that, when they replaced one of these cervicals, the \\u201cmeat\\u201d kind of sticks to the new cervicals, and the neck doesn't move as normally as it could.

What was the factor that was helping us do all of this movement, and figuring out a solution for that.\", \"sec\": 849, \"time\": \"14:09\", \"who\": \"Sara\"}, {\"line\": \"That was my third project. Then like all the other projects that came after that were related to my internship, where I started to do it\\u2026 It was an online internship \\u2013 this was my first online internship ever [chuckles] with STEM-Away. Actually, we had to figure out what type of topic a certain post can go to. So when you have a couple of forums like, for example, Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange \\u2013 you have people discussing a lot of topics. So, for example, you might have someone saying a certain discussion and you might want to classify which topic this might be for. For example, if it\\u2019s AI, is it computer vision, is it using deep learning, or something like that? So that was what the internship was about.

I mean, they go through traumatic events almost every day. So they were interested in developing a machine learning model and that's why the data was available. So we can say we struck luck. But, for example, for the Trash Out, what we did was\\u2026 We already had some data.

Normally, this happens with people who\\u2026 Even businesses that can't afford to buy data \\u2013 they get their own data from somewhere.

I mean, they go through traumatic events almost every day. So they were interested in developing a machine learning model and that's why the data was available. So we can say we struck luck. But, for example, for the Trash Out, what we did was\\u2026 We already had some data.

Can you tell us a few words about your career journey so far?\", \"sec\": 120, \"time\": \"2:00\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Sure. I've been in machine learning for about close to a decade now. My entry point into machine learning was more from the academic standpoint. I studied neuroscience and AI at Stanford. In addition to just ordinary coursework that I did while I was there, I had the really great pleasure and fortune of working in the NLP group. I worked with a lot of the really big names in NLP in the world, including Chris Manning, Zhilin Yang, Chris Potts, and Dan Jurafsky.\", \"sec\": 134, \"time\": \"2:14\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"One of the first real entry points in the machine learning research that I had was actually helping to lead up projects in collaboration with Ford, the big car automaker, where we were investigating new methods and primarily neural network-based techniques to conversational systems. We were building a lot of new architectures and building on new data sets and resources to really tackle this problem of deep learning for conversational systems.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"After Stanford, I joined a self-driving car startup in San Francisco called rideOS. I was there as one of the very early employees and got to get that first taste of what startup life is like. The focus of the company was actually a lot more on building a real-time data platform for optimizing and coordinating the movements of fleets of vehicles on the road. It was fundamentally a problem about engineering and how we can do things very efficiently.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"I was there for a while and when I left, I actually went to help start a new team at Amazon Alexa, which I've often described as a bit like a Google brain-esque effort within Alexa. It was similar in that the charter of the team was to kind of sit at this intersection between research and engineering. We did a lot of thinking about what research in conversational systems looks like today and how we can contribute to the research. But we were also constantly thinking about \\u201cHow can a lot of these advances make their way into the Alexa platform?\\u201d and \\u201cHow can we do that effectively so that we can deliver customer value?\\u201d So really, that was this nice hybrid of both the engineering and the research that came together in this nice way while I was there.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"Then, along the way, as you described, I've always been interested in education \\u2013 building tools and platforms to help people learn things \\u2013 Confetti being the most recent example of that. Nowadays, I'm doing a lot of consulting and working with a lot of companies across different verticals to help them solve their toughest business problems using data-driven and machine learning techniques.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"header\": \"NLP and self-driving vehicles\"}, {\"line\": \"That's pretty cool. You worked at Stanford in the NLP group, and then you went to a self-driving company. I'm wondering, what does NLP have in common with self-driving? How did you convince them to actually hire you?\", \"sec\": 300, \"time\": \"5:00\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"That's a question that they would maybe have to answer themselves. [laughs] How they picked me, I don't know. But from a problem domain standpoint, I think you're right. There doesn't seem to be as much overlap, in some ways. I would agree that fundamentally, they're very different problems. Though, I would say that, when you think of self-driving compared to NLP \\u2013 the difficulty of the problems \\u2013 they do have very similar characteristics. They're both very long tail problems, where a lot of the complexity comes in everything that happens after you have achieved 80% accuracy. I think that in NLP, as in self-driving vehicles, we can do pretty well on 80% of the phenomena. But really, the hardest part is everything that happens at that long tail. So those characteristics make them very similar.\", \"sec\": 319, \"time\": \"5:19\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"But I think that for me, a lot of what drew me to going into this particular company was that the team was just really phenomenal. It was a very high-performance engineering team of people that had built a lot of amazing systems at Uber, Tesla, Apple, and a lot of different companies. I'm sure we'll get into this, but a lot of what I've been thinking about coming out of research was, \\u201cHow do I become a better engineer?\\u201d So I felt like I should just throw myself into some really hard engineering problems and work with some really good engineers to become a better engineer myself. That was a lot of the motivation there.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"header\": \"Transitioning from academia to the industry\"}, {\"line\": \"Was that your biggest problem when you were transitioning from academia to the industry world? Was it the engineering aspects, or was it something else?\", \"sec\": 406, \"time\": \"6:46\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Yes, that's right. I think that when I was at Stanford, we were solving a lot of interesting problems. We did a lot of interesting research that I'm really happy with. But a lot of the time, when I was working on things, I felt that my engineering chops were maybe not at the level where I felt that I was doing things as effectively as efficiently as I could. There was an element of, you're doing things and you're building things, but maybe at times, even as I was setting up some infrastructure, I felt like I was kind of fumbling through it a little bit. It's not just that the code wasn't the cleanest \\u2013 research code tends not to be the cleanest, at least it\\u2019s not known to be. That's maybe not appealing from an aesthetic standpoint.\", \"sec\": 417, \"time\": \"6:57\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"But I think that the bigger problem for me was\\u2026 I'm a very relentless optimizer in terms of time. I like to do things very efficiently and effectively. When I see that there are maybe deficiencies in how I\\u2019m doing something, I think, \\u201cOkay, I need to spend the time to really build out that foundation and get better in those engineering aspects.\\u201d And I start to ask myself these questions, \\u201cOkay, how do I go from a proof of concept model to something that can interact with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people in a scalable way?\\u201d That's something that you don't really get to see in research too often, because those aren\\u2019t really the problems that researchers think about. So making that transition from a very research-minded way of thinking about things to \\u201cHey, build something that works and is robust.\\u201d That was really one of the bigger challenges.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"You mentioned, you were setting some infra as a researcher. I think that's quite uncommon for a researcher to set up infra to begin with, right?\", \"sec\": 514, \"time\": \"8:34\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Yeah, that's right. I mean, when I say infra, it's probably not infra in the most robust sense. Even just standing up web services and if you're setting up an annotation task and you have to interface with Amazon Mechanical Turk \\u2013 or you have to do any of these things. We were collecting audio data and being able to stream audio data over the web was difficult at times. Eventually, it got done and it worked. But it was not the cleanest and prettiest thing when it did work. So we thought \\u201cThere's got to be a better way than this.\\u201d\", \"sec\": 525, \"time\": \"8:45\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"So you first worked as a researcher. Then you worked more as an engineer in the self-driving startup. Then you joined Amazon to work in a more hybrid role \\u2013 your official position was ML researcher \\u2013 is that right?\", \"sec\": 561, \"time\": \"9:21\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Yeah, it was a scientist by title. \\u2018Scientist\\u2019 at Amazon can mean a lot of things. I mean, there are scientists that really focus primarily on engineering, and there are scientists that are literally just researchers. My role was set up in such a way that there was a lot of flexibility in the stuff that I was working on, especially because it was a new team. It was literally just my manager and I when it was started. Almost by necessity, I had to do a lot more engineering. Because when we started, there were just two of us. By the time I left, there were maybe 20 or so people in the team. A lot of the engineering, setting up of infrastructure, setting up the codebases, and all these things, kind of fell on me by default. Although I liked that \\u2013 I did actually like doing those things. Because of my prior experience in engineering, I thought, \\u201cWell, this is super fun anyway. Research is fun, but this is also fun.\\u201d So fundamentally, I ended up doing a lot of both. I wrote a lot of papers, but I also built systems that found their way into the Alexa platform.\", \"sec\": 576, \"time\": \"9:36\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"Yeah, that's pretty cool. So you basically managed to be in both worlds. You saw how things are done from the researcher\\u2019s point of view and how things are done from the engineering point of view. Then at Amazon, you were doing both. Right?\", \"sec\": 634, \"time\": \"10:34\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"That\\u2019s right.\", \"sec\": 651, \"time\": \"10:51\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"header\": \"Machine learning researchers\"}, {\"line\": \"Maybe you can tell us what machine learning researchers actually do. What kind of problems do they solve? What do they use for solving these problems?\", \"sec\": 652, \"time\": \"10:52\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Absolutely, yes. Machine learning researchers tend to focus a lot more on open-ended problems. These are open-ended problems from a scientific standpoint. There's a way of thinking about things where you don't really know if something is going to work, right? Researchers tend to be very hypothesis-driven. They will look at something and say, \\u201cAlright, how can I improve this through some modeling advancement or some architectural change or something like that? How can I do that?\\u201d And a lot of it does tend to be driven by hypothesis. So you don't know if it's going to work upfront, but you run experiments deliberately and methodically to try and validate those hypotheses. There's a lot of reading of papers, seeing what other people are doing, and then writing the papers when you maybe discover something interesting.\", \"sec\": 661, \"time\": \"11:01\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"I think as far as tooling is concerned, a lot of the tools that researchers in machine learning primarily use, are ones that enable really fast prototyping, or really fast validating or invalidating hypotheses. A lot of the usual suspects come up \\u2013 things like Jupyter-hub notebooks, they come up a lot, tools and platforms, like weights and biases \\u2013 things that allow you to keep a very detailed experimental log that allows you to invalidate or confirm your hypotheses.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"Hypotheses and open-ended problems\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"Can you think of an example of such a hypothesis? Like what it could be \\u2013 an open-ended scientific problem?\", \"sec\": 740, \"time\": \"12:20\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Yeah, absolutely. The nature of machine learning research today is a lot about benchmarks. There are benchmark datasets and things like leaderboards, in some cases. There are formal leader boards that come up. But really, there's some community agreed-upon dataset that people are trying to improve.\", \"sec\": 747, \"time\": \"12:27\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"Like ImageNet?\", \"sec\": 769, \"time\": \"12:49\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"ImageNet is a good one for computer vision. You can also think of something like Squad in the case of question answering for NLP. There are so many. But that's really how machine learning research has evolved, by centering around these different benchmarks. It's a way of standardizing and making sure that everyone's talking in the same language in some sense. You can imagine that when you're trying to improve the performance on these datasets, sometimes even just by really, really small amounts, you might say, \\u201cOkay, this model uses this one particular kind of architecture. What if I use a special kind of cross-attention between maybe the encoder and the decoder of something? Does that allow me to maybe propagate some information from the encoder to the decoder so that downstream I have an increase in performance?\\u201d So you might try that. You might build your model in such a way that you try and capture some of that signal and then see if it works. It's a lot of thinking-through about these different architectures.\", \"sec\": 770, \"time\": \"12:50\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"So if it works, you publish your paper. And if it doesn't, what happens then?\", \"sec\": 829, \"time\": \"13:49\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Well, then when you're back to square one. Then you're back to the drawing board for a lot of the time split. But I think that it doesn't always just have to be squeezing out half a percentage point by getting that perfect architecture. There are some papers that I've written in the past where we were just showing that you can use great simple things to do comparably as well as much more difficult architectures. There's even a line of work that's about \\u201cHow do I reduce the complexity of something without giving up on performance?\\u201d That can be reducing complexity in terms of the architecture or reducing complexity in terms of the model size or anything like that. But yeah \\u2013 fundamentally, if you can squeeze out percentage points of improvements and you write a good story, that ends up being a paper most of the time.\", \"sec\": 834, \"time\": \"13:54\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"header\": \"Finding open-ended problems\"}, {\"line\": \"Where do these open-ended questions come from? Do you have to come up with them yourself? Does your professor tell you about them or you work with companies from the industry to find them? How do you come up with these problems?\", \"sec\": 885, \"time\": \"14:45\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"There are different ways of doing that, I think. In the early parts of every researcher\\u2019s career, I think it's always very common to start by just serving what's out in a field. Nowadays, a lot of researchers have done good jobs of literally producing survey papers where they talk about the high-level problems that a certain field is talking about. They'll include all the relevant citations. If you read these surveys, especially early in my research career, you just do what is effectively like depth-first search through the citation landscape, right? Where you're like, \\u201cOkay, here's the paper. Here are a bunch of links. I understand this. I don't understand this. Okay, but this links to something else.\\u201d And you just kind of go down this rabbit hole of \\u201cHow are people thinking about problems?\\u201d And \\u201cWhat have they thought about before?\\u201d\", \"sec\": 904, \"time\": \"15:04\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"If you do this enough, and then you keep kind of going down this rabbit hole, eventually you get a really good sense for \\u201cWhat's the state of the art look like today?\\u201d Sometimes you'll discover that something that you're hypothesizing or thinking about that doesn't yet exist. Or maybe you'll see that someone sort of thought about something similar in the past, but they maybe never fleshed out this one particular detail. So then you think, \\u201cWhat if I combine what I'm thinking of with what they're thinking of. Can there be something new to come out of this?\\u201d\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"Like this \\u2018future work section\\u2019?\", \"sec\": 984, \"time\": \"16:24\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Exactly. Future work section \\u2013 a lot of the time. I think that's one fantastic aspect of research. If you go right down to the end of a paper, typically, they'll have the conclusion and they'll have like three or four open questions. They'll just say something like, \\u201cHey, we did really awesome work. But there are a few things we're not so sure about. So maybe you guys can think about this in the future.\\u201d That's actually a good place to find motivation as well. But then, also, depending on how the researchers that you're working with are \\u2013 they can also just give you ideas. Especially early in researchers\\u2019 careers, a lot of professors will have their own agendas and kind of a broad class of things that they're thinking about. So they're happy to share that. Because that's why they hired you, right? In some sense, it was to pursue a lot of their own research questions.\", \"sec\": 986, \"time\": \"16:26\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"So, you're there on your own. Maybe there are some tips coming from your supervisor \\u2013 from the professor \\u2013 but you're doing this breadth-first search yourself, right? You're reading these papers.

What do machine learning engineers do? What kind of problems do they solve and what do they use to do that?\", \"sec\": 1055, \"time\": \"17:35\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Unlike the sort of open-ended questions that researchers tend to think about, machine learning engineers tend to be more focused on the full machine learning lifecycle. Whereas a researcher might train a model, and their work is done. They might say, \\u201cOkay, I have my pickle file. I have my binary whatever. That's it.\\u201d And maybe \\u201cI've confirmed and validated a hypothesis.\\u201d An engineer is really responsible for going to the next step and saying, \\u201cOkay, now that I have the model, how do I handle all the other aspects of making a fully-fledged system that uses machine learning?\\u201d\", \"sec\": 1073, \"time\": \"17:53\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"That systematic aspect has a lot of things that fall under the curve, including deployments, \\u201cHow do I scalably deploy something? How do I make sure that there's uptime? How do I monitor that something is working all the time?\\u201d A lot of it really does have to do with those engineering aspects. With a machine learning engineer, of course, there's engineering that's involved in that. But I think that in some sense, the way the field has progressed, the machine learning aspect of it has actually become an even smaller part of the role. Nowadays, you might only have to use 20% of your time on machine learning, if even that, and really 80% of the heavy lifting is the engineering.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"So when I think about tooling that falls into an ML engineer\\u2019s toolkit, there are some of the usual suspects around modeling. You're almost certainly going to be using PyTorch or TensorFlow, or some high level modeling library. But a lot of your toolkit is also going to involve these more traditional engineering tools like Docker to help with reproducibility. Or you have to be very comfortable with the cloud provider in order to deal with cloud infrastructure, whether that's AWS or GCP, or Azure, or whatever. Then you also have to be very comfortable with a web framework \\u2013 something like FastAPI or Flask, depending on the language that you use for your backend services. So it's really this combination of some machine learning. Maybe not as much now as it was before, but then a lot of engineering.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"Okay. So researchers ask themselves open-ended questions. They come up with hypotheses, they test them, and then maybe if it works out, they come up with a better architecture. They have this pickle model file, or PyTorch model file, or whatever file. I don't know about University, but if it happens in a company, they can go to their fellow machine learning engineers \\u2013 their colleagues \\u2013 and say, \\u201cOkay, we have this file, now let\\u2019s figure out how to actually deploy this.\\u201d Is that right?\", \"sec\": 1191, \"time\": \"19:51\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Yeah, that's right.\", \"sec\": 1223, \"time\": \"20:23\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"header\": \"Is data science more engineering or research?\"}, {\"line\": \"What about data science? What is it? Is it more engineering or is it more research?\", \"sec\": 1225, \"time\": \"20:25\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Yeah, that's a really good question. I think data science has changed a lot in the last, maybe 8-10 years, maybe 5-10 years. I think that at a high level, data science has really gone through different phases. When data science really began as a field, I think it was this huge umbrella term. It still is an umbrella term, but especially back then. It\\u2019s what I think of as \\u2018Data Science 1.0,\\u2019 which is when, all of a sudden, companies and different groups realized that there was a lot of data that was coming in that had to be processed in some way. That was being combined with the fact that there would be modeling advancements, where now people were trying to see \\u201cHow can I extract some insight from those new data sources that we now have?\\u201d But what ended up happening, I think, is that people just went on hiring splurges. They just hired a bunch of data scientists to \\u2018do data\\u2019 \\u2013 whatever that meant. There wasn't really a clear strategy about \\u201cWhat does it mean to extract insight from data?\\u201d And \\u201cHow do you do that in a way that actually helps a company?\\u201d as an example.\", \"sec\": 1231, \"time\": \"20:31\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"So that was data science at one point. I think that now we're living through what I consider \\u2018Data Science 2.0,\\u2019 which is where we are starting to realize and develop systems for going from extracting the data insights to something that's commercially viable and that can deliver value to people. Building out that pipeline and building that system is something that we're really refining nowadays. A lot of the time it is really more engineering than it is science. That's not to say that science isn't there \\u2013 there absolutely is science there.

I think it's a very interesting question, honestly. I've worn a lot of different hats in my career, and depending on the room that I'm in and that I've been in, you deal with people that think very, very differently. There is actually this pretty big disconnect between how scientists and researchers think about things and how engineers tend to think about things. I think some of the actual problems that I've seen \\u2013 sometimes these two roles don't really appreciate each other, or what one contributes to the other. But I really do believe that in the best of all possible worlds, and the best of all possible organizations, they see that the best things happen when they work together and collaborate very closely.

Engineers tend to think about things in terms of very deterministic systems. They build systems that are very robust, and that have this very kind of expected predictable path through. There's a lot of rigor in how engineers build systems. That's not something that we typically think of when we think of researchers. Researchers are sort of more exploratory. They think about these ad hoc problems, or they think about, \\u201cHey, what happens if I do this?\\u201d They maybe don't have the same level of structure that an engineer will have.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"But I think that if you adopt some of the practices around engineering, even just the low-level programmatic aspects \\u2013 how you code something \\u2013 that involves testing more thoroughly, using things that static typing. I think that will make you much more effective. But then I think that engineers are also really good at having a very scrappy way of doing things. When engineers face a problem, they are very good about saying something like, \\u201cAlright. Roll up your sleeves. Let's dive into any part of the stack we need to in order to solve the problem.\\u201d So they really are comfortable going across the full stack.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"Whereas researchers \\u2013 at least a lot of researchers that I've worked with in the past \\u2013 they sometimes have this mentality of \\u201cWell, certain problems are beneath me.\\u201d And then maybe, like, \\u201cI really just think about science. I just think about research. I don't really want to think about how to spin up an EC2 instance.\\u201d Or something along those lines. That's just not something they concern themselves with, or even want to concern themselves with. But I think that's a pretty destructive mindset, honestly. Because if you don't think about these things, and you aren\\u2019t comfortable with some of these engineering aspects, then you're gonna introduce dependencies in your own work. If you're a researcher and you want to do something, you're gonna have to use a cloud provider. So if you don't know how to use that, then you're gonna have to depend on someone else just to do even the most basic things. That'll slow you down. I don't think it's the best way to do things. I think adopting some of that scrappiness is really useful for researchers.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"On the counter side, I think that researchers have a lot of things they can offer engineers as well. Researchers are really good at dealing with situations of uncertainty. This is something that happens in machine learning all the time, right? We talked about uncertainty in hypothesis-driven research. But even for any company that's doing any machine learning, there's a whole lot of uncertainty that building machine learning models introduce. \\u201cWill it even work? Will it work as well as I think it will? I don't know. It's hard to say.\\u201d\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"But a researcher is incredibly comfortable with that way of thinking about things because that's all they do. They think about things in probabilities, right? \\u201cThere's some chance that\\u2019ll work and some chance that it doesn't work.\\u201d But engineers, especially ones that are classically trained, are maybe not super comfortable with that level of uncertainty in their work. They really want that kind of strict \\u2018if/then\\u2019 relationship. It makes sense, right? If you deal with engineering systems, you've never asked yourself, \\u201cWill I be able to query my database?\\u201d Or \\u201cWill I be able to write to my database?\\u201d You just expect that these things will happen.

I've definitely worked with engineers in the past where they'll build something and they'll sort of run some experiments.

They're coming to those conclusions because they haven't maybe been as deliberate about hyperparameter tuning or refining some aspects of the model, which is something that researchers are super good at doing.

How can I add something else?\\u201d I think going through that exercise, in the same way, that for researchers doing the engineering exercise will teach them a lot, going through the research exercise will also teach you a lot about uncertainty in work and how you can do things in a way where you keep track of things very well and iterating on things constructively.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"By improving state-of-the-art, I don't think you mean going there and beating the first position in ImageNet? You mean something like improving accuracy and things like that, right?\", \"sec\": 2992, \"time\": \"49:52\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"I mean, that would be great. If you can do that, then more power to you. I think just trying to get to the point where you're even just taking a state-of-the-art system and fiddling with it a little bit to see, \\u201cWhat does it mean?\\u201d Like \\u201cHow hard is it really if I took something off of the transformers library?\\u201d Which is supposed to be state of the art.\\u201d At first \\u201cCan I reproduce the state of the art?\\u201d and then, \\u201cWhat happens if I start like adding a thing here and there?\\u201d I mean, great \\u2013 if you can build it and you can train state-of-the-art systems \\u2013 that's fantastic. Then you may have another job waiting for you somewhere else at DeepMind or whatever. But even just trying to pull it and seeing what it means to have a state-of-the-art system is also informative.\", \"sec\": 3002, \"time\": \"50:02\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"It probably doesn't have to be state-of-the-art worldwide \\u2013 it can be just within your company. Maybe there is a model, like a recommender system or some classification system. You can try to figure out what's going on there and how these things work. Maybe you'll notice some things that could be improved and then you can come up with a suggestion, and then try to improve it. This way, of course, you need to track everything \\u2013 track your experiments \\u2013 and then be able to show later to others \\u201cOkay, I actually tried this and it works. Here's the experiment. Let's now integrate this into our system. Let's improve it.\\u201d Right?\", \"sec\": 3042, \"time\": \"50:42\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Exactly. That\\u2019s absolutely right.\", \"sec\": 3087, \"time\": \"51:27\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"header\": \"Reading papers\"}, {\"line\": \"Your first point was about reading papers. I remember for me, I was a Java developer, and then I got into my Master\\u2019s degree \\u2013 I was doing my Master Thesis \\u2013 and then I needed to read papers. I opened this paper, and there was a lot of math. The language is so boring and it puts me to sleep. That was my impression, I don't know if it's true for everyone. But sometimes they are written in a language that makes it sound more complex than it should be. Right? So how do you actually go about reading these papers when you don't understand half of the symbols in them? Maybe you recognize sigma for sum, but for others\\u2026? How do you do that?\", \"sec\": 3088, \"time\": \"51:28\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"That's right. Yeah, researchers are definitely guilty of that. Not even from a joke standpoint, that's actually very true. This is a whole separate topic of conversation around \\u201cHow do you get accepted into a conference?\\u201d And \\u201cHow do you maybe inflate something so that it sounds cooler?\\u201d You add the math to make it seem cooler and more sophisticated than it actually is. That's a whole separate topic of discussion.\", \"sec\": 3139, \"time\": \"52:19\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"But you're right. I think that, especially if you don't come from that world, these papers can be very dense and very difficult to read. There are alternatives, though. One really good thing that has happened because of how popular machine learning has become, is that people have gotten really good at summarizing and trying to create their own understandings of papers. Thus, you have a lot of great tutorials \\u2013 some of them are interactive tutorials that people have written for a lot of models and papers about models. So if something is too dense for you in its raw form in the primary source, then there are certainly secondary sources that people have done well and explained well.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"Then there\\u2019s another thing that I think can help. If you're committed to going through that exercise, then I would collaborate with a researcher. I would pull in a researcher if something doesn't make sense and say \\u201cWhat does this mean? Like, I get the sigma, but can you explain what this is doing?\\u201d Adding that layer of collaboration will also just be good for team building. That's what a researcher is supposed to be good at. They should be able to give you insights. As far as the boredom is concerned, that aspect is a bit harder to sell [laughs] whether or not you find it boring.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"Basically, it\\u2019s the same advice for researchers \\u2013 pull in machine learning engineers, or engineers, to do code review. You can actually apply it here the other way. Just get a researcher, try to read the paper together and ask them to translate this thing for you. Ask questions. Okay, cool.\", \"sec\": 3247, \"time\": \"54:07\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Also, I think nowadays many papers actually have code, either from the authors or somebody who tried to reproduce the results and put the code somewhere there. I think that could also be helpful for engineers. Maybe engineers understand code better. Although I'm not sure if this code is written by researchers or not. If that\\u2019s the case, it could be difficult to understand. Probably going through the code could be even easier.\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"If you find a good code base \\u2013 absolutely. But a big caveat to the people that are listening \\u2013 and this is something I've seen in my career and I always try to get them out of this mindset whenever I work with researchers \\u2013 research code is not the best in the world. It can be stale and not updated very frequently. So yeah. Good luck. It's almost like if it doesn't work from the first go, good luck diving into it and trying to understand what the matrices are doing and what each one represents.

Let's say somebody is listening to this podcast, and they're maybe doing their Bachelor\\u2019s, and they are thinking, \\u201cOkay, should I go to industry and work as an engineer?

How should they choose?\", \"sec\": 3331, \"time\": \"55:31\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Yeah. I think that's where one of the most important things is to be introspective. You really have to ask yourself, \\u201cWhat parts of these problems am I most interested in?\\u201d If you understand what each of the roles does \\u2013 if you understand that, as a machine learning engineer, you'll be handling a lot more engineering nowadays. Or if you\\u2019re doing a full-stack data scientist role, likely, it's gonna be a lot of engineering. If you're aware of those responsibilities, then that's important when you choose. But you first have to understand what you are getting yourself into in either situation.\", \"sec\": 3356, \"time\": \"55:56\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"In one, you're going to be on deployment, monitoring, handling all these engineering aspects, maybe a little bit of modeling, but not really as much nowadays. Then on the science aspect, you're typically just going to be working on open-ended problems, a lot of experiments, the tooling might be a little bit different. If you understand that base level, \\u201cHere's what each role entails.\\u201d Then you can ask yourself, \\u201cWell, okay. Does one field pull me more than the other?\\u201d I think in the ideal situation if you're really early on in your career, I suggest going and trying and do a little bit of both. If you can, that is.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"I think that one of the really great things about being at the early part of your career is that you have the flexibility to work on internships where you can do things that maybe you will never do further on in your career. But at least you can see what it's like to do those things. I remember very early in my career, I did nanofabrication work in an electrical engineering lab, where I was wearing like a Breaking Bad bunny suit, literally growing carbon nanotubes. I spent a good four or five months doing that and I was like, \\u201cThis is cool, but it's not something that I can see myself doing long term.\\u201d So giving yourself the opportunity to try that, even just for a little bit, it's a pretty low-risk way to see if something really resonates with you. And then if you can see yourself doing that farther along in your career.\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"line\": \"I don't know if this is good advice, but what worked for me was \\u2013 I did a Master\\u2019s, and in Germany Master\\u2019s degrees are free. I know that in the States that\\u2019s not the case. But I needed to write my Master thesis. For that, I needed to read a lot of papers, and I needed to experiment a lot. By doing this for half a year, I realized that maybe this is not the thing I enjoy doing the most. So it could be a way of checking as well. Just go and do something. You don't have to do a Master's for that, especially if it costs an arm and a leg.\", \"sec\": 3473, \"time\": \"57:53\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Yeah, if you're in an institution that has research labs, I always recommend for undergrads to do research, even if it\\u2019s just to try it. Most places have really good research professors. If you're working with a PhD student, they're always happy to have someone help. So if you just go and knock on a PhD student\\u2019s door and say, \\u201cHey, I can code pretty well. Can I just do some research with you?\\u201d I've rarely seen someone saying no.\", \"sec\": 3511, \"time\": \"58:31\", \"who\": \"Mihail\"}, {\"header\": \"Confetti.ai\"}, {\"line\": \"Okay. I know we should be wrapping up, but I have one more question that you will probably like. I wanted to ask you a few words about your project \\u2013 Confetti. What is it? What is it for? And what is there?\", \"sec\": 3536, \"time\": \"58:56\", \"who\": \"Alexey\"}, {\"line\": \"Yeah. It\\u2019s a project that a friend of mine and I started about a year and a half ago \\u2013 it was born over a dinner conversation once in the Bay Area. Really, we came to this conclusion that we have been doing so much interviewing and we've gone through so many different parts of our career thinking about machine learning and the \\u2018right\\u2019 machine learning role and data science. We found ourselves sort of recreating and reinventing ways of doing things and ways of preparing for these things. Between the two of us, we've done hundreds of interviews, and every time we found ourselves kind of patching together different resources to understand \\u201cHow do I prepare for this? What are the kinds of questions that are going to be asked?\\u201d When it comes to data science machine learning rules, there's really not a standardized process for preparing for these roles.

I saw that transition, of course, in my career \\u2013 how the role evolved. So Confetti was really like a tool that we built to really scratch our own itch and say, \\u201cIf I were starting today, what would I want someone to tell me about not only \\u2018how I get a job in these fields?\\u2019 but what should I be thinking about going into a career in this field?\\u201d And \\u201cHow do I dispel and share that knowledge with other people, so that others can learn from my mistakes?\\u201d Which I've made more than my fair share of. Confetti was really this platform that we built to try and codify a lot of these best practices that we have learned over the course of our time, based around \\u201cHow do I prepare to be a machine learning engineer?
